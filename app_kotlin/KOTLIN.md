# Kotlin Web Application

## Programming language Choice: Kotlin

I chose **Kotlin** because:

- I am an android developer, and it is my favourite programming language

## Framework Choice: Ktor

I chose **Ktor** because:

- It is lightweight and designed for Kotlin applications.
- Provides an easy-to-use routing system.
- Supports templating and static file serving.

## Best Practices Followed

- Used **Ktor** routing to handle requests.
- Followed **Kotlin coding conventions**.

## Functionality
