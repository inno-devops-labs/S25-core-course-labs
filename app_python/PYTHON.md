# Moscow Time Application

## Framework Choice
I chose Flask because:
- It is lightweight and easy to set up.
- It has extensive documentation and a lot of tutorials.

Additionally, I used the `pytz` library to handle timezone conversion.

## Best Practices
- Used Flask's routing and template rendering to dynamically show Moscow time.
- Followed a clear project structure of logical code sections.
- Avoided redundancy and prioritized simplicity.

## Coding Standards
- Followed PEP 8 for clean and readable code.
- Used **Lower Camel Case** for variable and function names to maintain consistent naming conventions.

## Testing
- Tested the application to verify that the current Moscow time updates correctly upon refreshing.
- Manually checked the responsiveness and usability of the web interface.
