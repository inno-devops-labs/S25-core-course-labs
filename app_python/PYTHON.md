# Python Application to display Moscow Time

## Framework choice

- Flask: was chosen for its simplicity and flexibility. Flask is the best option for this task that ensures development
         without adding complexity

## Coding standard
- Python's PEP 8 standards
- Structure: the code has good name variables that ensures readability

## Testing Description
For the testing of the application we have 3 tests:

- First test: check that page loads succesfully with HTTP code 200
- Second test: check if the response contains text "Current time in Moscow, Russia:"
- Third test: check if the time displays

## Best practices for code testing
- Fast: unit tests take not a much time
- Self-checking: automatic detection of its results
- Isolated: unit tests are standalone in a single 'test_cases.py' file
