# Python Moscow Time Web App

## Framework Choice

I chose **Flask** as the framework for this project
because it is ***lightweight*** and ***easy to set up***,
making it suitable for small projects, such as displaying the current time.

## Best Practices

- **Modular Code**: The application is structured in a modular way.
  The business logic is separated from presentation through the use of templates.

- **PEP 8 Compliance**: The code conforms to PEP 8,
  Python's style guide for writing readable code, ensuring consistent formatting.

- **Naming Conventions**: snake_case is used for all variables and functions
  to enhance code readability and maintainability.

- **Code Comments**: Individual sections of the code are documented.

- **Integration testing**: Unit / Ui testing is implemented with
  Flask test client to ensure that primary functionality is valid
