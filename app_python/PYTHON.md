## framework choice
I chose flask as a suitable framework for my web application because it is 
easy and most used for small web apps.

## best practices
-used 'requirements.txt' file for dependencies
-clean folder structure
-followed PEP8

## testing
- tested locally to ensure time updates on page refresh
- used 'pytz' library to handle timezone
