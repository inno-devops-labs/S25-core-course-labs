 ## Framework Choice

For this project, I chose Flask web framework because it is lightweight,  simple to use and very extensible. With Flask, one can easily create small applications like this one  without having to write too much boilerplate code. Also, Flask is well documented and has a huge  community of developers which makes it perfect for both starters as well as professionals.

## Best Practices

- **Function Naming**: Functions were named appropriately (`moscow_time`) to reflect their purpose clearly.
- **Modular Code**: I separated concerns by keeping the route logic simple and contained.
- **Timezone Handling**: The `pytz` library is used for accurate timezone calculations, which ensures the application is reliable and correct.
- **PEP 8 Compliance**: The code follows Pythonâ€™s PEP 8 style guide, including proper indentation and function naming conventions.
- **Testing**: The application was tested manually by visiting the URL and ensuring that the time updated correctly on page refresh.
