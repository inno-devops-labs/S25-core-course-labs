# Python Web Application

## Framework Choice

We chose Flask as the framework for the following reasons:
1. Lightweight and beginner-friendly.
2. Easy to set up and run small applications.
3. Flexible with various extensions for future scalability.

## Best Practices Implemented
1. Modular structure to separate logic in future.
2. PEP 8 compliance for clean and readable code.
3. Use of `pytz` library for accurate timezone handling.

## Testing
1. Tested locally by running the application and refreshing the browser.
2. Verified that the time updates correctly upon each page load.
