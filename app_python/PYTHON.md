## Flask Framework
For this exercise, I chose Flask due to its simplicity. The task doesnâ€™t require heavy infrastructure, so, for example, Django unnecessarily complex for this task. Flask's lightweight nature makes it perfect for small to medium-sized projects like this one.

## Best Practices
- Use logging for every request made to the page  
- I followed PEP 8 guidelines  
- Use `venv` for dependency management
- Using **Docker container** for easy deployment

### Unit Tests

#### âœ… Test Cases Implemented

- **test_moscow_time**: Ensures that the endpoint `/` returns a successful response and contains the expected "Moscow time :" text.
- **test_time_format**: Validates that the returned timestamp follows the format `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S`.

#### ðŸ§ª Testing Approach

- Used `pytest` for writing and executing tests.
- Applied the `pytest.fixture` mechanism to set up a test client for the Flask app.
- Verified response status codes and output correctness.
