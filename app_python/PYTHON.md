Flask is easy to install and configure to use for small applications, and allows you to create a simple web apps with minimal effort.
In addition, flask uses the Jinja2 templating engine, which makes it easy to generate dynamic HTML that fits for our project.

- Enabled debug mode for easier developing app.
- Usage `pytz` for accurate time handling.

### Coding Standards:
- Followed PEP 8.
- Used meaningful names for functions and variables.

### Testing:
- Manually tested the application by refreshing the web page to confirm that the displayed Moscow time updates accurately.

## Code Quality
- `flake8` for PEP 8 style checking.
