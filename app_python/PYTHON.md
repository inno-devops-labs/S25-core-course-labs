### 1. Choice Justification
Flask is easy and beginner-friendly framework that allows fast webapp coding. Hopefully, if the future labs will require us to extend this application, __flask lightweight nature__ will support highly covering the lack of __built-in admin interface__ that [Django](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_(web_framework)) has.

### 2. Best Practices
1. [Docstring](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) briefly explaining every program component/module involved in the system. Yes, this regards Python conventions rather, but always putting reasonable comments makes developers/readers understand the structure faster... In most of the cases.
2. Constants Usage. In such a small example of moscow_app.py making MOSCOW timezone a constant makes no use, but in larger projects by changing the address of this variable all the rest code will get a new reference.
3. Confident requirements.txt via automatic __'pip freeze > requirements.txt'__ command.

### 3. Coding Standards. The way to follow standards.
