# Lab 1: Web Application Development

## Framework

For this task I chose `flask` because the project we are working on is small and simple which makes a framework like `flask` a great fit for the task

## Best practices applied

- **Separation of Concerns:** The logic and the presentation in the app are sperated following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern
- **Minimalistic and effecient code:** The code does exactly what it should do without any extra features and unecssary complexity, making it easier to understand and maintain

## Code standards and code quality

- **PEP8 Compliance:** The code follows PEP8, making it easier to read and understand
- **Clear and descriptive names:** The use of descriptive names for the function and variables in the code making it easier to understand code
- **Documented code:** The code is documented making it easier to read and understand the code's workflow
