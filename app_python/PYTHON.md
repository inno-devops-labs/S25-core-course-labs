# Python Web Application

## Framework Choice
I selected Flask due to its lightweight nature, ease of deployment, and flexibility.

## Best Practices Implemented

- **Logging:** The application records request data, timestamps, and errors.
- **Virtual Environment:** Dependencies are managed using `venv`.
- **Code Standards:** PEP 8 compliance is ensured.
- **Testing:** Both unit and integration tests validate the application.
- **Error Handling:** Flask logs errors and unexpected behavior.

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Validate the core function `show_time()`.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure the application serves responses correctly.
