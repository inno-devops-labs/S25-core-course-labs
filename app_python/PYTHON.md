# Python Web Application

## Framework

I chose **Flask**. Flask is a framework for building web applications in Python. It is lightweight and fast to use, yet powerful enough to create full-fledged applications. Projects created in Flask fit into a single code file. The framework has extensive and well-structured documentation, which can help me in my development.

## Best Practices Applied

- **Linting**: I performed code validation using `pylint` to adhere to Python's coding standards.
- **Code Formatting**: I used `black` to maintain consistent code style and readability.
- **Code Readability**: I used meaningful function names and dockstrings to ensure clarity.
- **Version Control**: Project is maintained in Git with clear commits and patch requests.
- **.gitignore**: Excludes unnecessary files like virtual environment and cache files.
