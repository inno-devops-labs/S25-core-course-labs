# Python Web Application Documentation

## Framework Choice: Flask

I chose Flask as the web framework for this application for the following reasons:

- **Lightweight**: Flask is a micro-framework that provides the essentials without unnecessary overhead
- **Simple to Set Up**: Minimal boilerplate code required to get started
- **Flexible**: Easy to add only the components we need
- **Well Documented**: Extensive documentation and large community support
- **Perfect for Small Applications**: Ideal for our single-endpoint time display application

## Best Practices Applied

### Code Organization
- Followed modular project structure
- Used proper package organization
- Implemented D.R.Y. (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Used relative imports appropriately

### Code Standards
- Followed PEP 8 style guide for Python code
- Used type hints for better code readability
- Added meaningful comments while avoiding redundancy
- Kept functions small and focused

### Documentation
- Added docstrings following PEP 257 conventions
- Maintained clear code documentation
- Created comprehensive README.md
- Documented all dependencies in requirements.txt

### Testing
- Implemented unit tests for time conversion logic
- Added integration tests for web endpoints
- Used pytest as testing framework
- Verified Moscow time display functionality
- Ensured time updates on page refresh

### Moscow Time Implementation
- Used pytz library for proper timezone handling
- Set up 'Europe/Moscow' timezone
- Implemented accurate time conversion
- Added time refresh functionality
- Displayed time in user-friendly format

### Code Quality
- Used pylint for code quality checks
- Added try/except blocks for timezone conversion errors
- Specified exact dependency versions in requirements.txt
- Named variables descriptively (e.g., moscow_time, formatted_time)
- Used Black code formatter for consistent style
- Imported only required modules (pytz, flask)
- Created small, focused route handler for time display
- Separated app configuration from main logic

## Development Process

1. Set up virtual environment
2. Created project structure
3. Implemented Moscow time functionality
4. Added comprehensive tests
5. Created documentation
6. Set up .gitignore
7. Generated requirements.txt

## Future Improvements

- Add more comprehensive logging
- Implement caching for better performance
- Expand test coverage
- Add monitoring tools
