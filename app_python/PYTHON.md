# Web Application Description

## Best Practices

1. **Framework**: Flask was chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness for small applications.
2. **Modular Structure**: The code is split into backend (Flask routes), frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and static assets.
3. **Separation of Concerns**: The backend logic and frontend code are kept separate to improve maintainability.

## Coding Standards

1. **PEP 8**: Code adheres to PEP 8 guidelines for readability and consistency.
2. **Naming Conventions**: Clear, descriptive names are used for variables, functions, and files.

## Unit Testing

Tests use pytest to ensure reliability:

- **Home Page Test**: Confirms the `/` route returns status 200 and contains "Current Time in Moscow."
- **Setup**: Uses Flask's test client and pytest fixtures.
- **CI Integration**: Tests run automatically via GitHub Actions.

## Conclusion

The application uses Flask, follows best practices for maintainability, and is designed for easy updates. Manual testing is performed to ensure functionality.
