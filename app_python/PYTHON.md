# Python Web Application Documentation

## Framework Choice
I choose **FastAPI** for these reasons:
- It is modern, fast, and highly performant.
- It provides built-in support for asynchronous programming.
- It includes automatic API documentation (Swagger UI and ReDoc).
- It is well-suited for both small and large applications.

## Best Practices
1. **Modular Code Structure**: The application is organized into a single file for simplicity, but it can be easily modularized for larger projects.
2. **Error Handling**: Custom exception handlers are implemented for 404 (Not Found) and 500 (Internal Server Error) scenarios.
3. **Logging**: Logging is implemented to track server activity and errors. Logs are saved to `app.log` and printed to the console.
4. **Static Files**: Static files (CSS) are served using FastAPI's `StaticFiles` middleware.

## Coding Standards
- Followed **PEP 8** guidelines for Python code formatting.
- Used meaningful variable names and added comments where necessary.
- Maintained a clean and organized file structure.

## Testing
- Unit tests are written using `unittest` to verify the functionality of the application.
- Run tests using the command: `python -m unittest tests/test_app.py`.

## Code Quality
- Used **type hints** for better code readability and maintainability.
- Added logging to monitor the application's behavior and debug issues.
