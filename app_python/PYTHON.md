# Why Flask?

## Framework Choice
For this web application, **Flask** was chosen as the web framework for the following reasons:

1. **Lightweight & Minimalistic**  
   - Flask is a micro-framework, meaning it has no unnecessary dependencies, making it fast and efficient for small web applications.

2. **Easy to Learn & Use**  
   - Flask has a simple and intuitive API, making it ideal for quick development.

3. **Flexible**  
   - Unlike larger frameworks like Django, Flask does not impose strict rules on how the application should be structured.

4. **Extensibility**  
   - Flask allows developers to add only the components they need, avoiding unnecessary bloat.

5. **Active Community & Good Documentation**  
   - Flask has an active developer community and extensive documentation, making problem-solving easier.

## Best Practices Implemented
### **Coding Standards**
- Followed **PEP8** for clean and readable code.
- Used **virtual environments** to manage dependencies.
- Kept the code modular and easy to maintain.

### **Testing**
- Manually tested to ensure the time updates correctly.
- Ensured Flask's built-in debugger is disabled in production.

### **Code Quality**
- Used a minimal **requirements.txt** file to include only necessary dependencies.
- Ensured that the application is **lightweight and efficient**.
- Followed a **clear folder structure** for better organization.

## Alternative Frameworks Considered
| Framework | Why Not? |
|-----------|---------|
| **Django** | Too heavy for a simple project, has a lot of built-in features that are not needed. |
| **FastAPI** | Great for APIs but overkill for a basic web page. |
| **Bottle** | Similar to Flask but has a smaller community and fewer extensions. |

### **Final Choice: Flask**
- Best balance between **simplicity**, **flexibility**, and **efficiency** for a small web project.

## Summary
Flask was the best choice for this project because it is lightweight, easy to use, and allows for rapid development while following best practices.
