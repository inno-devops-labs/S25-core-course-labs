# Best Practices for Python Web Application

## Overview

This document outlines the best practices applied in the Python web application that displays the current time in Moscow.

## 1. Code Structure

- **Modular Design**: The application is structured using Flask, which allows for clear routing and separation of concerns.

## 2. Timezone Handling

- **Timezone Management**: The application uses the `pytz` library to handle the Moscow timezone correctly, ensuring accurate time representation.

## 3. Template Rendering

- **Separation of Logic and Presentation**: The application uses `render_template` to separate the HTML presentation from the application logic, promoting cleaner code.

## Conclusion

The current implementation follows basic best practices for a Python web application, focusing on modular design, timezone handling, and template rendering.
