# Choose a suitable framework for your web application and justify your choice
For this web application I chose FastAPI, because this task is very easy and can be done using any framework,
so I use the advantage of being familliar with FastAPI in advance. 
It is most suitiable for this task, since it saves time of developing.

# Unit testing
In unit testing I tested most important features such as endpoint response in general and time increasing on refresh.
