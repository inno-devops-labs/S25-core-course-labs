# Python Web Application Documentation

## Chosen Framework: Flask

I chose [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) because:

- it is beginner-friendly and great for small projects like this one
- it has a flexible structure, so I can customize the code as needed
- easy and clear documentation for quick start

## Best Practices

1. **PEP 8 Compliance**  
   - All code follows PEP 8 style guidelines to ensure readability and consistency. flake8 can verify style adherence.

2. **requirements.txt**
   - All dependencies are described in requirements.txt file in root of the project so they could be all easely installed using pip.

3. **Logging**
   - Basic logging is set up using Python’s logging module to track activities within the application.

4. **Modular Structure**  
   - While this is a straightforward app, the code is structured to allow for future scaling.
   - If needed, additional modules for configuration, utilities, or routes could be added.
