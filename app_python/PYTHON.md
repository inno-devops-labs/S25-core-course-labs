#Flask

## Why I choose Flask
1. Lightweight and simple
2. The project is small and Flask is known for it's quick development
3. I don't have to install many dependencies making starting using Flask easier than explaining why I'm using Flask)

# Best Practices Applied in the Web Application

## 1. Code Structure
- Created a separate function `get_moscow_time()` to improve code reusability and maintainability.
- Used Flaskâ€™s templating engine to separate business logic from presentation.

## 2. Coding Standards Followed
- Followed **PEP 8** coding standards to improve readability.
- Used **docstrings** for functions to improve documentation.
- Applied **meaningful variable names** to enhance code clarity.

## 3. Testing Implemented
- **Manual Testing**: Verified the Moscow time updates upon page refresh.
- **Automated Testing**: Used `unittest` to ensure the home page loads correctly.
