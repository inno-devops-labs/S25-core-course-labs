# Web Application to Display Current Time in Moscow

This document explains why the **Flask** framework was chosen for the development of the web application that displays Moscow's current time. It also provides a detailed explanation of how the `app.py` (Python code) and `index.html` (HTML template) files work.

## Why Flask Was Chosen

Flask is a lightweight and flexible Python web framework suitable for small to medium-sized applications. Here are the reasons for choosing Flask:

1. **Minimalistic and Easy to Use**:
   - Flask is simple to set up and requires minimal boilerplate code, making it ideal for quick development of small-scale applications.

2. **Flexibility**:
   - Flask does not enforce specific tools or libraries, allowing developers to customize the application as needed.

3. **Integrated Templating System**:
   - Flask uses the Jinja2 templating engine, making it easy to render HTML templates dynamically by passing data from Python code.

4. **Active Community and Documentation**:
   - Flask has a large, active community and excellent documentation, which ensures that developers can easily find solutions to any issues.

5. **Sufficient for the Task**:
   - Since the application is simple (fetching and displaying the current time), Flask's lightweight nature is a perfect fit without unnecessary overhead.

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template
from datetime import datetime
import pytz

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def show_time():
    # Get the current time in Moscow
    moscow_tz = pytz.timezone('Europe/Moscow')
    current_time = datetime.now(moscow_tz).strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
    
    return render_template("index.html", time=current_time)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Run the Flask application
    app.run(debug=True)
```

        h1 {

        }
        p {

            color: #555;
        }
    </style>

    <div class="container">
        <h1>Current Time in Moscow</h1>
        <p>{{ time }}</p>

```
# Unit Tests 

### 1. **Test: `test_time_format`**
   - **Purpose**:  
     Verify that the HTML response from the Flask endpoint `/` contains a time string in the format `HH:MM:SS`.
   - **Method**:  
     - Uses a regular expression (`\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}`) to match the time format.  
     - Fails if the pattern is not found in the response body.

---

### 2. **Test: `test_time_in_response`**
   - **Purpose**:  
     Ensure the HTML response includes the **current Moscow time** in the correct format.  
   - **Method**:  
     - Fetches the current time in the `Europe/Moscow` timezone.  
     - Checks if this time appears in the response body.  
     - Validates the response MIME type is `text/html`.

---

## Best Practices Applied

### 1. **Test Isolation with Fixtures**  
   - **`client` Fixture**:  
     - Creates a dedicated test client for the Flask app.  
     - Enables `TESTING` mode to propagate exceptions and disable error catching.  
     - Uses `yield` to clean up resources after tests complete.  
     ```python
     @pytest.fixture
     def client():
         app.config["TESTING"] = True
         with app.test_client() as client:
             yield client
     ```

---

### 2. **Explicit Path Configuration**  
   - **Dynamic Imports**:  
     Adjusts `sys.path` to ensure the app module is importable, even if tests are in a nested directory.  
     ```python
     sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "..", "..")))
     ```

---

### 3. **Time Validation**  
   - **Time Zone Awareness**:  
     Uses `pytz.timezone("Europe/Moscow")` to fetch the current Moscow time, ensuring timezone correctness.  
   - **String Format Matching**:  
     Validates the time format with regex to avoid false positives from arbitrary numbers.  

---

### 4. **Response Validation**  
   - **MIME Type Check**:  
     Confirms the response is HTML (`assert response.mimetype == "text/html"`).  
   - **Content Assertions**:  
     Checks for the presence of the expected time string in the response body.  

---

### 5. **Error Messaging**  
   - **Descriptive Assertions**:  
     Uses custom failure messages (e.g., `"Time format is incorrect"`) for clearer debugging.  
     ```python
     assert time_match is not None, "Time format is incorrect"
     ```

---

### 6. **Flask Testing Mode**  
   - **Enabled via `app.config["TESTING"] = True`**:  
     - Disables Flaskâ€™s error handlers during testing.  
     - Propagates exceptions to the test runner for accurate failure reporting.
