## Framework Choice
We chose FastAPI as our web framework due to its high performance, ease of use, and support for asynchronous programming. FastAPI provides automatic interactive API documentation which makes it easier to develop and test APIs quickly.

## Best Practices Applied
- Modularized code structure.
- Proper error handling.
- Use of environment variables for configuration.
- Clean and readable code with proper comments.

## Coding Standards
- Followed PEP 8 style guide for Python code.
- Used meaningful variable and function names.
- Added docstrings where necessary.

## Testing
- Manually tested the application by refreshing the page and verifying the time update.
- Ensured the application runs without errors in debug mode.
