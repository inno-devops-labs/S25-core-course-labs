This Python Flask application demonstrates the use of best practices for building a small, maintainable, and efficient web app.

# Frameworks and Libraries Used


## 1. Flask:
Flask is a lightweight web framework that is both flexible and secure, making it ideal for small applications like this. It integrates seamlessly with the Jinja2 templating engine to ensure secure rendering of dynamic HTML, protecting against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks by default. Flaskâ€™s modularity also allows easy scaling, while built-in features like session management and support for HTTPS enhance security.


## 2. Requests:
The `requests` library simplifies HTTP communication by providing an intuitive API for sending and receiving data. It ensures secure API interaction by defaulting to TLS/SSL for HTTPS, and its timeout and error-handling capabilities mitigate risks like hanging requests or uncaught HTTP errors. These features make it a reliable and secure choice for fetching external data.




# Coding Standards

1. **PEP 8 Compliance:**
   - Followed Python's PEP 8 guidelines for code formatting to ensure readability and consistency.
   - Used descriptive variable names such as `moscow_time` and `formatted_time` to make the usage of each variable clear.
   
2. **Comments and Handling Errors:**
   - Added comments to explain critical steps in the code.
   - Used a `try-except` block to handle errors gracefully when API calls fail.

3. **Secure and Performant Code:**
   - Limited the timeout for the API request (`timeout=5`) to avoid hanging indefinitely in case of server issues.
   - Used `response.raise_for_status()` to ensure HTTP errors are handled explicitly.

# Testing and Debugging

1. **Manual Testing:**
   - Tested the Flask app locally to ensure that:
     - The API integration works correctly.
     - Errors are displayed in case of issues (e.g., slow Internet connection or invalid API response).
     - The rendered HTML template is properly updated with the correct time.

2. **Error Handling:**
   - Used an `except` block to catch and display errors. This avoids exposing sensitive error details to users.
   - Included fallback behavior (e.g., displaying an error message) when API calls fail.

# Code Quality

1. **Dependencies:**
   - Used a `requirements.txt` file to list only the necessary dependencies (`flask` and `requests`).


2. **HTML Integration:**
   - Followed semantic HTML practices in `index.html` for accessibility and clarity.
   - Used CSS for responsive and visually appealing UI design.
