# Python Web Application

## Framework Choice: FastAPI

FastAPI was chosen for following reasons:
- **High Performance**: FastAPI is one of the fastest Python web frameworks.
- **Asynchronous Support**: Native support for async/await.
- **Automatic Documentation**: Generates interactive API documentation automatically.

## Best Practices

1. **Modular Code**: The application is structured in a single file for simplicity, but it can be easily modularized.
2. **Error Handling**: FastAPI automatically handles validation errors and provides detailed error messages.
3. **Environment Variables**: For production, environment variables should be used for configuration (port, host).
