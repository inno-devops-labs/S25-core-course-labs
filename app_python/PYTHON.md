## Moscow Time Web Application

## Framework Choice

I choose Flask python framework, because it suitable for web applications.

## Applied best practices

I follow KISS and DRY best practises in my code every time. Also, I write clear documentation and comments to my code.

## Testing

First, I run the application and test manually.
I refresh page several times to ensure that time displays correctly.
Also, I check dev tools.
I see that layout is responsive, and page looks good in different devices and sizes.
I verify that the API requests are being sent correctly and that the time displayed is accurate according to Moscow's timezone.
