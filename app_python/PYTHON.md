# Code Quality and Best Practices

---

### PEP 8 standards
The application follows Python's PEP 8 standards -> clean and maintainable code. 


Flask is used for modular development, separating routing, templates, and static assets for clarity and scalability. 

### Try / catch
Error handling is implemented with a `try...except` block to prevent unexpected crashes, while `pytz` ensures accurate timezone management.

### Testing
It is a basic manual testing, that verified correct functionality, responsive design. In future I can add some unit/integral tests, maybe logging, and `CI/CD` pipelines for automated quality checks. Like, autogenerated beta of app in every pull request.
