# Python Web Application

## Framework Choice: Flask
Flask was chosen for its simplicity, lightweight design, and ease of use for small web applications. It is beginner-friendly and suitable for displaying dynamic data like the current time.

## Best Practices
- Followed Python's PEP 8 coding standards.
- Separated the logic into clear routes and functions.
- Used `requirements.txt` to manage dependencies.
- Verified the code with testing.

## Testing
- The application was manually tested by refreshing the page to confirm the time updates dynamically.
