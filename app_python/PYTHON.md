# Python Web Application (Django)

## Why Django?
- Django follows the **Model-View-Template (MVT)** architecture.
- Model(M) handles the database and business logic, View(V) contains the logic to process user requests and return responses, and Template(T) manges the HTML structure and presentation.
- This all makes the codebase more maintainable and scalable.
- Built-in admin panel, security features, and easy routing.

## Best Practices:
- Used `pytz` for timezone accuracy.
- Followed Django's **MVT architecture**.
- Structured project properly with `views.py` and `urls.py`.
- Used `.gitignore` to ignore unnecessary files.
