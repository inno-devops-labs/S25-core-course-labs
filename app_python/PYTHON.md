# Code details
## Framework choice
I had a choice between Flask and Django,
as they are the most popular and well-known web frameworks for Python.
The first option was more preferable, since
`Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework.
It is designed to make getting started quick and easy,
with the ability to scale up to complex applications.`
(<i><a href='https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/'>from official Flask documentation</a></i>).
## Best practices applied
- PEP8 compliance
- Meaningful functions, variable names
- Error handling. Custom page was created for not-found (404) error,
it also follows the main page's design.
- Testing was done manually, comparing the displayed time with well-known and independent
similar sites (https://time.is/MSK, https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/russia/moscow)
