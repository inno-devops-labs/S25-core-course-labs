# Best Practices for Python Web Application

## Overview

This document outlines the best practices applied in the Python web application that displays the current time in Moscow.

## 1. Code Structure

- **Modular Design**: The application is structured using Flask, which allows for clear routing and separation of concerns.

## 2. Timezone Handling

- **Timezone Management**: The application uses the `pytz` library to handle the Moscow timezone correctly, ensuring accurate time representation.

## 3. Template Rendering

- **Separation of Logic and Presentation**: The application uses `render_template` to separate the HTML presentation from the application logic, promoting cleaner code.

## Unit Testing for Flask App

### 1. Best Practices Applied
- Used `pytest` for test automation.
- Utilized `Flask-Testing` for Flask-specific testing.
- Implemented fixture-based test client setup.
- Verified response status codes and content.
- Ensured that the page contains the correct Moscow time.

### 2. Implemented Tests

1. **Homepage Status Test**
   - Ensures that the homepage loads successfully (HTTP 200).

2. **Moscow Time Display Test**
   - Verifies that the current Moscow date is displayed on the page.

3. **Homepage Template Test**
   - Checks if essential elements exist in the HTML template.

4. **Invalid Route Test**
   - Ensures that an invalid URL returns a 404 error.

To run tests, execute:
```sh
pytest test_app.py
```


## Conclusion

The current implementation follows basic best practices for a Python web application, focusing on modular design, timezone handling, and template rendering.
