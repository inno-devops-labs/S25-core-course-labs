# Python web-application

### Framework: `Flask`
I have chosen this lightweight web framework due to its simplicity
in usage. It is easy to create a toy web application with Flask.
Moreover, it is flexible and easy to extend in the future if needed.

### Best practices
* **Modularity**: HTML code and CSS styles are splitted from the Python code
* **Error handling**: checking whether the given timezone exists or not
* **Easy to update/modify**: the name of the city and appropriate timezone are in global vars
* **Comments**: help to navigate in the code


### Testing
Checked manually for different cities and timezones (for instance,
Europe/Berlin and Asia/Tokyo). Moreover, checked the behaviour in case of an invalid
timezone.
