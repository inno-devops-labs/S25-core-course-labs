# Python Web Application

## Framework Choice
We used Flask because:
- It is lightweight and simple.
- Quick to set up and deploy.
- Supports route handling efficiently.

## Best Practices
- Followed PEP 8 coding standards.
- Used environment-specific configurations.
- Kept dependencies minimal in `requirements.txt`.

## Testing and Quality
- Verified Moscow time updates correctly on refresh.
- Used Flask's built-in debugging for troubleshooting.
