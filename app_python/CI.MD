# Continuous Integration (CI) Workflow Documentation

This document outlines the best practices and improvements implemented in the CI workflow for this project.

## Workflow Enhancements

### 1. Workflow Status Badge
A status badge has been added to the `README.md` file to provide visibility into the CI pipeline's status. The badge reflects whether the pipeline is passing or failing.

### 2. Build Cache
Dependencies are now cached using GitHub Actions' `actions/cache`. This reduces build times by avoiding redundant downloads of dependencies.

### 3. Fail Fast
The workflow is configured to fail fast, stopping execution immediately if any step fails. This saves resources and provides quicker feedback.

### 4. Snyk Vulnerability Checks

Snyk has been integrated into the CI workflow to identify and address vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies. The following steps were implemented:

 - Added a step to run `snyk test` on the `requirements.txt` file.
 - Added a step to monitor the project for ongoing vulnerability detection.

## Conclusion

These improvements enhance the efficiency, reliability, and security of the CI workflow. By applying best practices and integrating tools like Snyk, the project is better equipped to deliver high-quality software.
