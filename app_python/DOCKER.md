# Docker Best Practices Implementation

This document outlines the Docker best practices implemented in our Dockerfile:

## Security best practices

1. **Non-root user**
   - Created a dedicated non-root user `appuser`
   - Application runs with limited privileges
   - Reduces security risks in case of container compromise

2. **Specific base image version**
   - Using `python:3.11-alpine3.19` instead of latest tag
   - Ensures reproducible builds
   - Alpine-based image for minimal attack surface

## Optimization best practices

1. **Layer optimization**
   - Dependencies installed in a separate layer
   - Application code copied after dependencies
   - Improves build caching and rebuild speed

2. **Minimal image size**
   - Alpine-based image for smaller footprint
   - Only necessary files copied into container
   - No development dependencies included

3. **.dockerignore Implementation**
   - Excludes unnecessary files from build context
   - Prevents copying sensitive files
   - Reduces build context size

## File management

1. **Selective file copying**
   - Only essential files copied: `app.py` and `requirements.txt`
   - Development and version control files excluded
   - Reduces image size and potential security risks

## Runtime configuration

1. **Clear port exposure**
   - Port 8000 explicitly exposed
   - Documents the application's network interface

2. **Proper WORKDIR usage**
   - Dedicated working directory `/app`
   - Prevents conflicts with system files
   - Improves organization and security
