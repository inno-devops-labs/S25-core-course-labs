# Best Practices Implemented in the Dockerfile

1. **Precise Base Image:** Using ```python:3.11.5-slim``` ensures consistency and minimizes vulnerabilities compared to the ```latest``` tag.
2. **Non-Root User:** The container runs as ```appuser```, following the principle of least privilege for better security.
3. **Minimal Base Image:** Using ```slim``` reduces unnecessary layers and image size.
4. **Efficient Layering:**
    - Dependency installation happens before copying application code to optimize caching.
    - ```COPY requirements.txt /app/``` allows the dependency layer to be reused if ```requirements.txt``` has not changed.
5. **Environment Variables:**
    - ```PYTHONUNBUFFERED``` ensures immediate logging output.
    - ```PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE``` avoids writing ```.pyc``` files, reducing unnecessary disk usage.
6. **.dockerignore:** ```.dockerignore``` file ensures to exclude unnecessary files.
