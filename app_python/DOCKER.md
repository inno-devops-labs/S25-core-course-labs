# Docker Best Practices for Flask Application

This document outlines the best practices employed in the Dockerfile for my Flask application.

## 1. Multi-Stage Builds

The multi-stage builds optimize the final image size. By separating the build environment from the runtime environment, we ensure that only the necessary files and dependencies are included in the final image. This reduces the attack surface and improves performance:

``` Dockerfile

# First stage: Builder
FROM python:3.9-alpine3.15 AS builder


# Setting the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements file and install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt 
```

## 2. Minimal Base Image

The Dockerfile uses the official Python image based on Alpine Linux. Alpine images are lightweight and contain fewer vulnerabilities:

``` Dockerfile

FROM python:3.9-alpine3.15

```

## 3. Non-Root User

To enhance security, the application runs as a non-root user. This minimizes the risk of privilege escalation attacks and adheres to the principle of least privilege:


``` Dockerfile

RUN addgroup -S appgroup && adduser -S appuser -G appgroup

USER appuser

```


## 4. Clear Separation of Concerns

The Dockerfile is structured to clearly separate the installation of dependencies from the application code. This makes it easier to manage and maintain the Dockerfile:


``` Dockerfile

# Copy installed dependencies from the builder stage
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages /usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages

```

## 5. Use of COPY Instead of ADD

The Dockerfile uses the `COPY` instruction instead of `ADD` for copying files. This is a best practice because `COPY` is more explicit and does not have the additional functionalities:

``` Dockerfile

COPY app.py .
COPY templates/ ./templates/

```

## 6. Exposing Ports

The Dockerfile explicitly exposes the port that the application listens on. This documentation helps users understand how to interact with the container:

``` Dockerfile

EXPOSE 5000

```

## 7. Labels for Metadata

Labels are added to the Docker image to provide metadata such as the maintainer, version, and description:
``` Dockerfile

LABEL maintainer="your_email@example.com" \
        version="1.0" \
        description="Flask application to display current time in Moscow"

```

## Conclusion

The Dockerfile for my application is optimized for security, performance, and maintainability.
