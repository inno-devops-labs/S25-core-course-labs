# Docker Best Practices

1. **Use a precise version of the base image and language**:
   - The Dockerfile starts with a `FROM` directive specifying `python:3.12-alpine3.18`. This ensures that the base image used is a specific version of Python (3.12) and a lightweight Alpine-based.

2. **Create a non-root user and set permissions**:
   - The Dockerfile creates a non-root user `appuser` using the `adduser` command to improve security by running the application with reduced privileges.
   - It also creates the `/app` directory and sets its ownership to the `appuser` to ensure that the application files are stored in a directory with appropriate permissions.
  
3. **Layer Sanity**
    - The Dockerfile arranges all instructions rationally to reduce the number of layers that are produced, making the final Docker image more effective and controllable.
  
4. **.dockerignore**
   - To ensure that sensitive data and unnecessary files are not included in the Docker image, we use a `.dockerignore` file to exclude extraneous files and folders from the build context.

5. **Set the working directory in the container**:
   - The `WORKDIR` directive sets the working directory inside the container to `/app`, ensuring that subsequent commands are executed in the correct directory context.

6. **Copy only necessary files**:
   - The `COPY` directive copies only the necessary files (`requirements.txt` and `app.py`) into the `/app` directory within the Docker image. This reduces the size of the image and minimizes the attack surface.

7. **Set Ownership During COPY**:
   - Ensures that the copied files and directories are owned by `appuser`, preventing permission issues during runtime.

8. **Make port 8080 available**:
   - The `EXPOSE` directive exposes port 8080, allowing external access to the application running inside the container.

9. **Configure logging directory**:
   - The Dockerfile creates a `/app/logs` directory inside the container to store log files generated by the application. This separates logs from application code and ensures proper organization.

10. **Switch to Non-Root User**:
    - Running the application as a non-root user enhances security.
