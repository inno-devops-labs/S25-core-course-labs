# Dockerfile Best Practices

Creating efficient, secure, and maintainable Docker images involves several key practices:

1. **Use Minimal Base Images**:
    - reduces image size and minimizes security vulnerabilities

2. **Set a Working Directory**
    - organzes application files and simplifies command execution

3. **Efficient Dependency Installation**
    - leverages docker caching for faster builds and keeps the image lean by avoiding package caches

4. **Use Non-Root Users**
    - enhances security by preventing applications from running with root privileges
