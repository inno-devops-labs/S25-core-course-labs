# Docker Best Practices

- Right base image
- Right sequence of steps to optimize further building processes and leveraging the build cache
- Maintainer information included
- Usage of .dockerignore file
- Creation of independent container
- Pinning of base image with sha256 digest
- Usage of ENTRYPOINT instead of CMD
- Copying of only right and needed files
- Port explicitly exposed
- Usage of non-root user
