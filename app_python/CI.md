# CI Best Practices Documentation

This document outlines the continuous integration best practices implemented in our project:

1. **Modular Workflow Jobs:**
   - Separates building, testing, and Docker operations into distinct jobs for clarity and better error isolation.

2. **Caching:**
   - Caches pip dependencies to accelerate build times using `actions/cache`.

3. **Code Quality Assurance:**
   - Uses `flake8` for linting to enforce coding standards.

4. **Security Scanning:**
   - Integrates Snyk to scan for vulnerabilities in project dependencies.

5. **Docker Integration:**
   - Automates Docker login, build, and push steps to streamline container deployment.

6. **Conditional Triggers (Bonus):**
   - Allows triggering workflows based on specific directory changes (see Bonus Task below).
