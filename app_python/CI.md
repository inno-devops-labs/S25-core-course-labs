# CI/CD Best Practices

## GitHub Actions CI

- **Automated Code Testing**: Ensures all commits are tested before merging.
- **Linting with flake8**: Helps maintain code quality.
- **Docker Build & Push**: Automates deployment.

## Workflow Optimizations

- **Build Caching**: Dependencies are installed first to optimize Docker caching.
- **Parallel Jobs**: Testing and Docker builds run in separate jobs.
- **Status Badge**: Displays CI status in `README.md`.
