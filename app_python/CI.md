# Best Practices for CI workflow

## Workflow Status
- I have added a status badge to visually track the CI status. The badge is available in the README.md file.

## Dependency Caching
- Dependencies are cached based on the hash of the requirements.txt file so that the cache is updated only when the dependencies change.

## Parallel Test Execution
- I run tests in parallel to speed up the validation process.
