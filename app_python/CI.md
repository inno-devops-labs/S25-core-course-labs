## CI best practices used

### Commit frequently

- Throughout my testings of my CI workflow itself I was commiting very frequently.

### Automate tests

- The tests I have created previously are automatically checked.

### Keep builds fast and simple

- Other than the `SNYK` security, I consider that all the elements simple, but I am sure that all of them are fast.

### Take a security-first approach

- Despite this little project's simplicity, I have incorporated SNYK to check the security of it.

### Monitor and measure your pipeline

- I have been checking all the measures that gitlab provides to check my pipelines.

### Involve the whole team in CI/CD implementation

- I am the entirety of my team and so the whole team is involved.

### Choose your CI/CD tools with care

- Apart from SNYK, I personally checked all tools that my CI/CD uses and picked the best practices. The tools have 
excellent Community Support, wonderfully Integrate and should be Scalable, if I chose to expand this project.

### Keep the builds green

- I did not stop fixing the issues until my build was green.

### Clean your environments

- Github cleans my environment.

### Secure your pipeline

- I have taken extra care to make sure that all the keys are secure.
