# Continuous Integration (CI) Best Practices

This document outlines the best practices implemented in the GitHub Actions CI workflow for this project.

## Workflow Enhancements

1. **Workflow Status Badge**:
   - Added a status badge to the `README.md` file for visibility into the CI pipeline.

2. **Caching**:
   - Used the `actions/cache` action to cache Python dependencies, reducing workflow execution time.

3. **Parallel Jobs**:
   - Split the workflow into multiple jobs (`test`, `docker`, `snyk`) to run tasks in parallel.

4. **Fail Fast**:
   - Configured the workflow to stop early if a critical step fails.

5. **Environment Variables**:
   - Used environment variables for configuration (e.g., Docker Hub credentials, Snyk token).

6. **Snyk Integration**:
   - Integrated Snyk to identify and address vulnerabilities in project dependencies.

## How to Run the CI Workflow

The CI workflow is automatically triggered on `push` to the `master` branch and on `pull_request` to the `master` branch. To manually trigger the workflow, go to the **Actions** tab in the GitHub repository and click **Run workflow**.

## Snyk Vulnerability Checks

Snyk is used to scan the project for vulnerabilities in dependencies. To view the results:
1. Go to the Snyk dashboard.
2. Check the **Projects** tab for the latest scan results.
3. Address any vulnerabilities by updating dependencies or applying fixes.
