# Continuous Integration Best Practices

## Implemented Practices
1. **Caching Optimization**
   - Python dependencies caching using GitHub Actions cache
   - Docker layer caching for faster builds

2. **Matrix Testing**
   - Cross-version Python testing (3.9, 3.10, 3.11)
   - Isolated test environments

3. **Security Integration**
   - Snyk vulnerability scanning
   - Regular dependency scanning

4. **Efficient Workflow**
   - Concurrency control for duplicate runs
   - Path filtering to skip unnecessary builds
   - Parallel job execution

5. **Quality Gates**
   - Code coverage reporting
   - Linting with Flake8

6. **Docker Best Practices**
   - Cache optimization for Docker layers
   - Secure credential handling
