#CI workflow improvements and Best Practices

this document outlines best practives implemented in CI pipeline:

1. **Dependency Caching:** 
   - Use the `actions/cache` action to cache pip dependencies, reducing build times on subsequent runs.

2. **Automated Linting:** 
   - The pipeline runs flake8 to enforce code style, helping maintain a clean and readable codebase.

3. **Automated Testing:**
   - Unit tests are executed via pytest, ensuring that code changes do not break functionality.

4. **Docker Integration:**
   - Docker login, build, and push steps ensure that the container image is always up to date.
   - The Docker image is built using a specific base image (`python:3.10-alpine3.15`) and follows best practices like using a non-root user.

5. **Security Scanning:** 
   - The integration of Snyk vulnerability checks helps identify and address known vulnerabilities in our dependencies and container images.

6. **Workflow Optimization:**
   - The CI workflow is designed to run on pushes and pull requests to key branches, ensuring early detection of issues.
   - Caching and efficient layering in the Dockerfile further improve build performance.

These improvements collectively enhance our development process by automating code quality checks, reducing build times, and ensuring security.
