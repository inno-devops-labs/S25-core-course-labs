# CI Best Practices

## Optimizing CI Workflow
1. **Parallel Jobs**: Splitted jobs into independent stages (e.g., testing, security scans, and Docker builds).
2. **Dependency Caching**:
   - Used pip cache in setup-python to speed up Python dependency installations.
   - Applied --cache-from for Docker builds to prevent unnecessary rebuilds.
3. **Security Checks**:
   - Integrated Snyk to scan for vulnerabilities before deployment.
4. **Version Pinning**:
   - Explicitly specified dependency versions in requirements.txt for Python to ensure consistency.
   - Defined fixed versions for GitHub Actions dependencies to avoid unexpected failures.
5. **Automated Linting & Testing**:
   - Ensured code quality with `flake8`.
   - Used pytest to run automated tests on Python code.
   - Run unit tests automatically on each commit.

## Security Enhancements
### Snyk Integration
Snyk is used to scan the project for vulnerabilities before deployment.

## CI Efficiency Improvements
1. **Workflow Triggers**:
   - The Python workflow runs **only** when `app_python/**` changes.
   - This prevents redundant builds and speeds up CI execution.
2. **Incremental Builds**:
   - Leveraged Docker layer caching for faster image builds.
   - Ensured that dependencies are only installed when changes are detected.
3. **Fail Fast Strategy**:
   - Early test failures prevent unnecessary steps from running, saving resources and CI time.
   - Security scans are executed **only after tests pass** to avoid wasting resources on broken code.
