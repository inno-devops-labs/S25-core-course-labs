# Continuous Integration

## Workflow Optimization

- **Caching**: Pip dependencies and Docker layers are cached to improve build times.
- **Linter & Tests**: CI workflow ensures code quality with `flake8` and `pytest`.

## Security Enhancements

- **Snyk Vulnerability Checks**: Integrated Snyk to scan dependencies for security risks.
- **Secrets Management**: GitHub Secrets securely store API tokens and credentials.

## Best Practices Applied

- **Modular Jobs**: Split `build` and `docker` jobs to improve efficiency.
- **Fail Fast**: Linter and tests run before Docker build to prevent unnecessary steps if errors occur.
