# Continuous Integration Best Practices

## Implemented CI Practices

1. **Multi-stage Docker Builds**
   - Separated build and runtime stages for smaller final image size
   - Used `--no-cache-dir` with pip to reduce image size
   - Implemented proper user permissions with non-root user

2. **Efficient Dependency Management**
   - Caching pip dependencies in GitHub Actions
   - Using `--user` flag for pip installs to maintain clean system directories
   - Separate requirements copy for better Docker layer caching

3. **Security Best Practices**
   - Integrated Snyk vulnerability scanning
   - Set severity threshold to high
   - Added `--skip-unresolved` flag to handle dependency issues gracefully
   - Implemented health checks in Docker

4. **Workflow Optimization**
   - Matrix testing across Python versions (3.8, 3.9, 3.10)
   - Parallel job execution with dependency management
   - Proper working directory configuration
   - Linting and formatting checks

5. **Error Handling**
   - Added safety checks for .local directory copy
   - Implemented proper error handling in Docker build process
   - Used conditional directory creation to prevent build failures

6. **Documentation**
   - Maintained clear CI workflow documentation
   - Added status badges for visibility
   - Documented all implemented best practices
