# CI Workflow Best Practices

### Best Practices Implemented

- **Separate Jobs for Build, Test, and Deployment**: Ensures modularity and parallel execution.
- **Explicit Python Version Declaration**: Uses `setup-python` to standardize the environment.
- **Fail-Fast Mechanism**: Linter and tests run early to prevent deployment of faulty code.
- **Secrets Management**: Uses GitHub Secrets for authentication.
- **Snyk integration**: Snyk is integrated into the workflow to scan dependencies for vulnerabilities.
