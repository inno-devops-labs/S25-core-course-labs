# Continuous Integration (CI) Best Practices

## Overview

This document describes how we structured and optimized our GitHub Actions CI pipeline.

## Workflow Enhancements

1. **Workflow Status Badge**:

   - We added a status badge in our `README.md` to quickly see build status.

2. **Build Cache**:

   - Used `actions/cache@v3` to cache Python dependencies.
   - Reduces installation time on repeat builds.

3. **Linting & Testing**:

   - Early steps ensure code quality and correctness.
   - Fails fast if there's a lint or test error.

4. **Docker Build & Push**:

   - Separate job triggered only if tests pass.
   - Avoids pushing failing builds to Docker Hub/GHCR.

5. **Snyk Vulnerability Checks**:
   - Installed and authenticated Snyk.
   - `snyk test --file=requirements.txt` checks Python dependencies.
   - Workflow fails if vulnerabilities above medium are detected.

## CI Best Practices

- **Single Responsibility Steps**: Each step in the pipeline does exactly one thing (lint, test, build, push).
- **Secrets Management**: All sensitive tokens (Docker, Snyk) stored in GitHub Secrets.
- **Fail Fast**: Lint/test run before Docker build & push.
- **Caching**: Speeds up subsequent runs by avoiding redundant dependency installs.
- **Status Badges**: Provide immediate feedback on build status to developers.
