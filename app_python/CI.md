# Continuous Integration (CI) Best Practices

## Workflow Optimization
1. **Added Caching**: Speeds up dependency installation and reduces redundant work.
2. **Workflow Status Badge**: Provides visibility into build status.
3. **Automated Security Checks**: Integrates Snyk for dependency vulnerability scanning.

## Caching Dependencies
- Using `actions/cache` to cache pip dependencies based on `requirements.txt` changes.
- Reduces CI build time significantly.

## Snyk Security Integration
- Scans Python dependencies for vulnerabilities.
- Helps keep dependencies secure and up to date.
