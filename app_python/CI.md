## CI/CD Enhancements Implemented

### **Workflow Status Badge**

- Added a **GitHub Actions status badge** in `README.md`.
- Helps track **build status** at a glance.

### **Python Virtual Environment in CI**

- Ensures dependencies are installed **in an isolated virtual environment**.
- Prevents system package conflicts.

### **Dependency Caching**

- Used `actions/cache` to **cache Python dependencies**.
- Significantly **reduces pipeline execution time**.

### **Docker Build Optimization**

- Enabled **Docker Layer Caching** to **reuse existing image layers**.
- Speeds up the build process and reduces resource usage.
