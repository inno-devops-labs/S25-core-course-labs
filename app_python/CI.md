## Best Practices:

- Dependency Caching: Store Python dependencies between workflow runs to speed up the build process by caching them.
- Python Environment Setup: Configure the Python environment with the specified version.
- Install Dependencies: Install the necessary project dependencies.
- Code Linting: Use flake8 to check for code style violations and syntax errors.
- Unit Testing: Execute unit tests to verify the correctness of the code and prevent regressions.
- Security Scanning: Using Snyk to detect and address security vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
- Docker Image Build and Push: Build the Docker image and push it to Docker Hub for easy deployment.
- Build Cache for Docker: Use caching to speed up the Docker image build process.
- Secret Management: Use GitHub secrets for securely manage sensitive credentials.
