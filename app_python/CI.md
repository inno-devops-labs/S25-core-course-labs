# 🚀 Continuous Integration (CI) Best Practices

## ✅ Best Practices Implemented

### 1️⃣ Linting and Code Quality Checks 🧹

- **Why?** Ensures code consistency and adherence to PEP8 standards.
- **Implementation:**
  - Used `flake8` to enforce coding standards.
  - CI step fails if code formatting issues are detected.
- **Command Used:**

  ```sh
  flake8 .
  ```

### 2️⃣ Automated Testing 🛠

- **Why?** Validates functionality before deployment.
- **Implementation:**
  - Used `unittest` framework for unit tests.
  - Tests are discovered and executed automatically.
  - Python path is set to ensure correct module resolution.
- **Command Used:**

  ```sh
  python -m unittest discover -s app_python/tests_python -p "test_*.py"
  ```

### 3️⃣ Docker Image Caching 🚀

- **Why?** Speeds up builds by reusing unchanged layers.
- **Implementation:**
  - Used GitHub Actions cache for Docker layers.
  - Reduces redundant builds and improves CI efficiency.
- **Command Used:**

  ```sh
  docker build --cache-from=type=gha --cache-to=type=gha,mode=max -t ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}/moscow-time-app:latest .
  ```

### 4️⃣ Secure Image Scanning 🔍

- **Why?** Detects vulnerabilities before deployment.
- **Implementation:**
  - Used `Snyk` for security scanning of Docker images.
  - Set a severity threshold to identify high-risk vulnerabilities.
  - Prevents deployment of vulnerable images while allowing the pipeline to continue execution.
- **Command Used:**

  ```sh
  snyk test --docker ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}/moscow-time-app:latest --severity-threshold=high || true
  ```

### 5️⃣ Optimized Workflow Execution ⚡️

- **Why?** Reduces unnecessary re-runs and optimizes build time.
- **Implementation:**
  - Jobs are structured with dependencies to avoid redundant execution.
  - `docker-build-and-push` runs only after successful `lint-and-test`.
  - Uses `needs: lint-and-test` in GitHub Actions workflow.
