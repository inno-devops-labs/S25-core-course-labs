# CI Workflow Enhancements and Best Practices

## **Best practicies**

### 1. Workflow Status Badge

I have added a workflow status badge to my repository to provide immediate visibility into the CI status. This badge is included in the **README.md** file inside app_python folder and updates automatically based on the latest workflow run.

### 2. Build Cache Implementation

To reduce build times and improve efficiency, I have integrated caching for pip dependencies using GitHub Actions' cache functionality. The cache key is generated based on the contents of `app_python/requirements.txt`, ensuring that dependencies are only reinstalled when this file changes.

### 3. Snyk Vulnerability Checks

To help identify and address vulnerabilities in the project dependencies, I have integrated Snyk into CI workflow. Snyk scans the Python dependencies and reports any security issues.

The `SNYK_TOKEN` secret is configured in my GitHub repository settings.

### 4. Dependency Installation

- **Set up Python Environment:**  
  I used `actions/setup-python` to ensure the correct Python version is installed.
- **Upgrade pip and Install Dependencies:**  
  Dependencies are installed using the latest version of pip as specified in `app_python/requirements.txt`.

### 5. Testing and Linting

- **Unit Tests:**  
  The workflow runs unit tests using `pytest` to validate application functionality.
- **Linting:**  
  I use `flake8` to check code quality and enforce coding standards.

### 6. Docker Integration

- **Docker Hub Login, Build & Push:**  
  The CI workflow logs in to Docker Hub, builds a Docker image using a distroless Dockerfile, and pushes the image. This ensures that the application is containerized and ready for deployment.

### 7. Modular and Maintainable Steps

Each step in the workflow is designed to perform a specific task. This modularity makes the workflow easier to maintain, debug, and extend.
