# CI best practices

1. Automate Everything. Automate test, build and check vulnerabilities.
2. Comprehensive Testing. Run unit tests in CI pipeline to ensure correctness.
3. Code Quality Checks. Using code analysis tool as SNYK to see vulnerabilities in code.
4. Isolated Environments. Using secrets in github for env variables.
