# CI Overview

1. Each task is isolated and executed sequentially, simplifying the debugging process by clearly indicating whatâ€™s failing and where.

2. Important data is secured using GitHub repository secrets.

3. GitHub Actions are employed (such as checkout, setup-python, etc.).

4. Job execution is organized using the "needs" directive. This makes the sequence of jobs clear.
