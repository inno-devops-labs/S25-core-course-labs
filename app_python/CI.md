# Continuous Integration Best Practices

This project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation. Below are the best practices implemented:

## Workflow Enhancements
- **Status Badge**: Shows the latest build status in the `README.md`.
- **Parallel Jobs**: Runs security scans and tests separately to speed up the workflow.
- **Fail Fast**: CI stops execution early if a step fails.

## Build Caching
- **`pip` cache**: Reduces dependency installation time.
- **Docker Layer Caching**:
  - Uses `cache-from` to pull previous layers.
  - Uses `cache-to` to save the latest build state.

## Security Enhancements
- **Snyk Vulnerability Checks**:
  - Automatically scans for security vulnerabilities in Python dependencies.
  - Blocks CI if critical issues are detected.

These optimizations improve efficiency, maintainability, and security for our project.
