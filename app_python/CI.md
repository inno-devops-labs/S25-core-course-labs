# Continuous Integration (CI) Best Practices

## Overview

The CI/CD pipeline for the Moscow Time Web Application ensures automated testing, linting, security scanning, and efficient deployment.

## Key Optimizations

### 1. Selective Execution

- Runs only on relevant changes (`app_python/` and workflow files).
- Reduces redundant executions and speeds up feedback.

### 2. Dependency & Docker Caching

- **Python Caching:** Uses `pip` caching to speed up dependency installation.
- **Docker Layer Caching:** Reuses previous build layers to optimize image creation.

### 3. Code Quality Checks

- **Flake8 Linter:** Enforces coding standards and detects issues early.
- **Unit Testing:** Uses `unittest` to validate core functionality.

### 4. Security Analysis

- **Snyk Scan:** Identifies and mitigates vulnerabilities in dependencies.

## Future Enhancements

- Add test coverage reporting.
- Optimize parallel execution for faster builds.
- Extend security scans to Docker images.
