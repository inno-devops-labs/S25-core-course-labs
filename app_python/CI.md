# CI Workflow Improvements

# Best Practices Implemented

# 1. Optimized Workflow Execution
- Used caching for dependencies to speed up build times:

  ```yaml
      - name: Cache Dependencies
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: ~/.cache/pip
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/requirements.txt') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-pip-
  ```
  
# 2. Linting and Formatting
- Enforced code quality with `flake8` and added failure conditions for styling errors.

# 3. Automated Security Scanning with Snyk
- Integrated Snyk to detect vulnerabilities in dependencies:

  ```yaml
      - name: Run Snyk to check for vulnerabilities
        uses: snyk/actions/python-3.10@master
        with:
          args: --skip-unresolved app_python/
        env:
          SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
  ```
