# Continuous Integration (CI) Best Practices

## Overview

This document outlines the best practices implemented in the **Moscow Time Web Application CI** workflow.

## Best Practices Implemented

### 1. **Branch-Specific CI Execution**

- The CI pipeline runs only on pushes to certain branches.
- This prevents unnecessary workflow executions on feature branches, optimizing CI resources.

### 2. **Automated Code Testing and Linting**

- The `test` job runs on `ubuntu-latest` for consistency across builds.
- Uses `flake8` for linting and `pytest` for unit tests.
- Ensures code quality and catches errors before deployment.

### 3. **Dependency Caching**

- The `setup-python` action caches dependencies, reducing execution time.

### 4. **Sequential Job Execution with Dependencies**

- The `docker` job depends on the `test` job.
- This ensures that the Docker image is built and pushed **only if all tests pass**.

### 5. **Secure Docker Authentication**

- Uses GitHub Secrets (`DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD`) for authentication.
- Prevents hardcoding sensitive credentials.

### 6. **Efficient Docker Image Caching**

- Implements **Docker layer caching** to speed up builds.
- Uses `actions/cache@v3` to persist cache across builds.

### 7. **Optimized Docker Image Build & Push**

- Uses `docker/build-push-action@v5` to build and push images.
- Caches layers to **reduce redundant builds and speed up deployments**.
