# CI Workflow Best Practices

## Key Enhancements

- **Workflow Status Badge**: Status badge in the `README.md` provides real-time updates on the CI pipeline’s status.

- **Caching**:
    - **Python Dependencies**: Caching Python dependencies using `actions/cache@v2`. This reduces the time spent installing dependencies by reusing cached versions whenever possible.
    - **Docker Layers**: Docker image builds are now faster thanks to caching Docker layers. This is done using `docker/build-push-action@v4` and `actions/cache@v2`, which means we don't rebuild layers that haven’t changed, saving a lot of time.

- **Job Dependencies**: To ensure things run smoothly, the Docker job (`docker`) will only run if the tests in the `build-and-test` job pass. This prevents unnecessary Docker image builds when tests fail.

## Docker Integration

Once the tests pass, we build and push a Docker image to Docker Hub with `docker/build-push-action@v4`. 
The image is tagged with the latest commit version, ensuring the image stays up to date.
