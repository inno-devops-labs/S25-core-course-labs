# Python Web Application - Current Time in Moscow

## Overview

This is a simple Python web application that displays the current time in Moscow. It is built using the Flask framework and demonstrates best practices in web development.

## Features

- Displays the current time in Moscow.
- Animated cloud background to simulate a sky.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- pytz

## Local Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd app_python
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Docker Support

This application can also be run in a Docker container. Below are the instructions for building, pulling, and running the Docker image.

### Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image for this application, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the app_python directory**:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/app_python
   ```

2. **Build the Docker image**:

   ```bash
   docker build -t your_username/app_python:latest .
   ```

   Replace `your_username` with your actual Docker Hub username.

### Pulling the Docker Image

If you want to pull the pre-built image from Docker Hub, use the following command:

```bash
docker pull chr1st1na/app_python:latest 
   ```

### Running the Docker Container

To run the Docker container, execute the following command:

```
docker run -p 5000:5000 chr1st1na/app_python:latest
```

- This command maps port 5000 on your local machine to port 5000 in the Docker container.

### Accessing the Application

After running the container, open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to see the application in action.

## Unit Tests
To run unit tests, execute:

``` sh
pytest test_app.py
```

This will check:

If the homepage is accessible (HTTP 200).
If the page contains the correct Moscow time.
If the template includes the required elements.
If invalid URLs return a 404 error.

## CI Workflow

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The workflow is triggered on every push to the main branch or on pull requests.

### Workflow Details

1. **Dependencies**: Installs all the necessary Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
2. **Linter**: Runs `flake8` to ensure the code follows PEP8 style guidelines.
3. **Tests**: Executes unit tests using `pytest`.
4. **Docker**: Builds a Docker image of the application and pushes it to Docker Hub.

The workflow configuration can be found in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## Conclusion

This README provides an overview of the application, its features, and instructions for both local installation and Docker usage. For more details on Docker best practices, refer to the [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md) file.

## Visit Counter Feature

### Overview
The application now includes a visit counter functionality that tracks and persists the number of page visits.

### New Features
- **Visit Counter**: Tracks the number of visits to the main page
- **Persistence**: Visit count is stored in a file and persists between container restarts
- **New Endpoint**: `/visits` endpoint displays the total number of visits
- **Docker Volume**: Uses Docker volume for data persistence

### How it Works
1. Each visit to the main page (`/`) increments the counter
2. Visit count is stored in a file within a Docker volume
3. Access `/visits` to view the current visit count
4. Data persists even if the container is restarted

### Technical Implementation
- Visit data is stored in `/app/data/visits.txt`
- Docker volume `visits_data` is used for persistence
- Counter is implemented using simple file I/O operations
- New template `visits.html` displays the visit statistics

### Usage
1. Access the main page at `http://localhost:5000/`
2. View visit statistics at `http://localhost:5000/visits`
3. The counter will persist between container restarts due to volume mounting
