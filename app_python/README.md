## Continuous Integration (CI) Workflow

This project uses GitHub Actions to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. The CI workflow is defined in the [`.github/workflows/python-ci.yml`](.github/workflows/python-ci.yml) file.

### Workflow Overview

The CI workflow consists of the following jobs:

1. **Linting**:
   - Runs Flake8 to enforce code style and check for syntax errors.
   - Configuration: Max line length is set to 88 characters.

2. **Testing**:
   - Installs project dependencies using `pip`.
   - Runs unit tests using `pytest`.
   - Caches Python dependencies to speed up the workflow.

3. **Security Scanning**:
   - Uses [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) to scan for vulnerabilities in the project dependencies.
   - Requires a `SNYK_TOKEN` secret to authenticate with Snyk.

4. **Docker Build and Push**:
   - Builds a Docker image for the application.
   - Pushes the Docker image to Docker Hub.
   - Requires `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD` secrets to authenticate with Docker Hub.
