## Development

Contributions are not accepted at the moment as this is just a lab assignment. You can fork the repository for your own use.

### Unit Tests

Unit tests are maintained in the `test.py` file. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest app_python/test.py # Make sure that you are in the parent directory of app_python
```

To check the code coverage, use the following command:

```bash
coverage run -m unittest app_python/test.py
coverage report
```

### CI Workflow

A CI workflow is maintained in the `.github/workflows/python_app.yaml` file. This workflow lints and tests the application, and builds and pushes docker image. Workflow is triggered only if there is a push .

The CI workflow contains 2 jobs. Each job has a specific set of tasks to perform:

- Build: This job lints and tests the application
- Docker: This job builds and pushes the docker image to the Docker Hub. The job is carried out only if the build jobs are successful.
