## 🐳 Distroless Image Version

I implemented a **Distroless-based** image for the Python Moscow Time web application to enhance security and optimize performance.

### 📏 Image Size Comparison

| Image Type       | Base Image Used                        | Approx. Size |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Standard Image** | `python:3.11-alpine3.18`             | **62MB**     |
| **Distroless Image** | `gcr.io/distroless/base:nonroot`    | **71MB**     |

Unlike the Go application, the **Distroless Python image is actually larger than the Alpine-based image**.

---

### 📥 How to Build the Distroless Image

```bash
docker build -f distroless.Dockerfile -t azazaki/app_python:distroless .
