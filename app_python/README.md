# Overview

This web application displays the current time in Moscow and updates it every second. It uses Flask web framework and follows the best Python web practices.

## Tools

`Flask`: Chosen for its lightweight, ideal for small web applications like Moscow-time showing.

`pytz`: Properly handles timezone.

## Installation and run

1. Clone repo
2. Navigate to `app_python` directory
3. Install dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run using `python app.py`
5. Navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) and observe correct Moscow time

## Docker

This application is containerized with Alpine image because of its lightweight.

## Unit tests implementation
Unit tests are implemented for the Flask app to verify its functionality.
They check the main routes and ensure the application responds as expected. 

Tests execution:

```shell
python -m unittest tests/test_app.py
```
