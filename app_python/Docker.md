# Docker Best Practices

## **Best Practices Implemented in the Dockerfile**

1. **Use a Lightweight and Specific Base Image**  
   - I use `python:3.10-alpine` instead of a generic `python:latest` to ensure a smaller and more secure image.

2. **Run as a Non-Root User**  
   - The application does not run as root, preventing security vulnerabilities.
   - I create a dedicated user `appuser` and set permissions correctly.

3. **Use `.dockerignore`**  
   - A `.dockerignore` file is used to exclude unnecessary files (e.g., `.git`, `__pycache__`), reducing image size.

4. **Optimize Layer Caching**  
   - COPY only required files to minimize unnecessary rebuilds.
   - Install dependencies before copying application code to leverage Docker's caching mechanism.

5. **Multi-Stage Build for Efficiency**  
   - If compiling dependencies, use a **multi-stage build** to keep the final image lightweight.

6. **Expose Only Necessary Ports**  
   - I only expose **port 8000**, minimizing unnecessary open ports.

7. **Use a Minimal `CMD` for Running the Application**  
   - The app runs using `CMD ["python", "app.py"]`, ensuring an optimized execution.
