## CI Workflow Best Practices
- **Caching:** Use caching to speed up dependency installation.
- **Isolation:** Ensure each job runs in a clean environment.
- **Parallelism:** Run independent jobs in parallel to reduce build time.
- **Fail Fast:** Fail the workflow early if a critical step fails.
- **Security:** Use github actions secrets to protect sensitive Docker credentials.
