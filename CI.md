# CI/CD Best Practices

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. CI Workflow Status Badge
Added a badge in `README.md` to display the latest status of the workflow.

### 2. Dependency Caching
Used GitHub Actions cache to speed up dependency installation.

### 3. Automated Security Checks
Integrated Snyk to scan dependencies for vulnerabilities.

### 4. Workflow Efficiency
- Separated testing and deployment jobs.
- Used parallel execution where possible.
