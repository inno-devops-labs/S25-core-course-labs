# Web Application Description

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Modular Structure**: JavaScript functions are used to handle specific tasks, such as updating the counter on click.
2. **Event Handling**: Clicks on the cookie image are tracked using an event listener to increment the counter.
3. **DOM Manipulation**: The DOM is updated directly when the cookie is clicked, updating the counter.

## Coding Standards

1. **Consistency**: The code follows a consistent style, with clear and descriptive variable names.
2. **Single Responsibility**: Functions handle specific tasks, such as incrementing the counter.

## Conclusion

JavaScript is used to handle user clicks and update the display. The code is simple, clear, and functional.
