# JavaScript Web Application

## Framework Justification
I chose Node.js with the Express framework for this bonus task because it is a fast and scalable solution for web applications. Express simplifies routing and request handling.

## Best Practices
- The code uses modular functions for routing.
- Proper error handling is in place for real-world use cases.
- The app follows JavaScript's best practices for asynchronous operations.
