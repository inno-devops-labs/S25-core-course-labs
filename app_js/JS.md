# Why JavaScript?

## Framework Choice
For the bonus web application, **JavaScript with Express.js** was chosen as the backend framework for the following reasons:

1. **Fast & Asynchronous**  
   - JavaScript is event-driven and supports non-blocking I/O, making it ideal for handling web requests efficiently.

2. **Lightweight & Scalable**  
   - **Express.js** is a minimal and flexible Node.js framework that provides essential web functionalities without unnecessary overhead.

3. **Full-Stack Possibility**  
   - JavaScript can be used on both **frontend (React, Vue, etc.)** and **backend (Node.js, Express.js)**, making it a great choice for full-stack development.

4. **Large Ecosystem & Community Support**  
   - JavaScript has a huge developer community and an extensive collection of npm packages, making development faster and easier.
