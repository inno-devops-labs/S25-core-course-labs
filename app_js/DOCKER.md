# Docker Implementation Details

## Image Comparison

### Regular Image vs Distroless Image

1. Size Comparison
   - Regular Image: Based on Alpine Linux
   - Distroless Image: Minimal runtime environment

2. Security Benefits
   - Distroless images contain only your application and its runtime dependencies
   - No package manager, shells, or other programs that could be exploited
   - Reduced attack surface

3. Maintenance
   - Regular Image: Easier to debug (has shell access)
   - Distroless Image: More secure but harder to troubleshoot

## Best Practices Implemented

1. Multi-stage builds
   - Separate build and runtime stages
   - Reduces final image size
   - Improves security by not including build tools in final image

2. Non-root user
   - Application runs as non-privileged user
   - Improved security posture

3. Minimal base images
   - Alpine-based for regular image
   - Distroless for secure variant

4. Optimized layer caching
   - Dependencies installed before copying source code
   - Improves build time for subsequent builds

## Usage Instructions

See README.md for detailed instructions on building and running the containers.
