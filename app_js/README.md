# JavaScript Web Application - Current Time in Moscow

## Overview

This is a simple JavaScript web application that displays the current time in Moscow. It is built using Node.js and the Express framework. The application serves a web page that shows the current time in the Moscow timezone (MSK).

## Features

- Displays the current time in Moscow.
- Refresh the page to update the time.

## Requirements

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
- **Express**: The application uses the Express framework for handling HTTP requests.
- **MSK Timezone**: The application is set up to display the current time in the Moscow timezone.

## Local Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd app_js
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

4. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`.

## .gitignore

Ensure that your `.gitignore` file includes the following to avoid committing unnecessary files:

```
# Node.js
node_modules/
npm-debug.log
```

## Requirements.txt

For this JavaScript application, we do not use a `requirements.txt` file as it is common in Python projects. Instead, dependencies are managed through `package.json`.
