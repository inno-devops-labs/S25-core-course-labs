# Ruby Web Application

## Framework choice

To develop this web application, I chose the [**Sinatra**](https://sinatrarb.com/) web framework for Ruby. Sinatra is a lightweight web framework that is perfect for small applications.

## Best practicies

I implemented the following best practices in the development of this Ruby web application:

* MVC architectural pattern

* Tools for Code Quality & Security

  * [`RuboCop`](https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop): A static code analyzer and style checker for Ruby

  * [`Reek`](https://github.com/troessner/reek): A code smell detector

  * [`rails_best_practices`](https://github.com/flyerhzm/rails_best_practices) : A tool that checks for best practices in Ruby on Rails applications, even if you're using Sinatra framework

* I use `Gemfile` to manage dependencies

## Testing code

In addition to manually testing the application by running it and verifying the output, I have written automated tests using the `RSpec` testing framework. These tests ensure that the application behaves as expected and that future changes do not introduce bugs.
