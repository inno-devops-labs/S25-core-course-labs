# LOGGING

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the logging stack configured using **Promtail, Loki, and Grafana**. It explains how each component functions and how they interact to collect, store, and visualize logs.

## Logging Stack Components

### 1. **Promtail (Log Collector)**

- **Purpose**: Promtail collects logs from Docker containers and forwards them to Loki.
- **Configuration**:
  - Reads logs from `/var/lib/docker/containers/*/*log`.
  - Extracts metadata like `image_name` and `container_name`.
  - Sends logs to Loki at `http://loki:3100/loki/api/v1/push`.
- **Pipeline Stages**:
  - Parses logs as JSON.
  - Extracts timestamps and assigns structured labels.

### 2. **Loki (Log Aggregator)**

- **Purpose**: Loki stores logs received from Promtail and indexes them efficiently.
- **Configuration**:
  - Listens on port `3100` for logs.
  - Stores logs efficiently.
  - Organizes logs into streams based on labels like `image_name` and `container_name`.

### 3. **Grafana (Visualization Tool)**

- **Purpose**: Grafana queries logs from Loki and provides a user-friendly dashboard for visualization.
- **Configuration**:
  - Loki is added as a data source in Grafana (`http://loki:3100`).
  - Users can filter logs using labels.
  - Runs on port `3000`.

## Running the Logging Stack

To start the stack:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

To access components:

- **Application**: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
- **Grafana**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Logging Results

In grafana, we can query logs based on labels:

- `image_name`: Querying based on the image name of the containers we are running

    **Query:**
      ![image_name_query](images/loki/image_name_q.png)
    **Logs:**
      ![image_name_logs](images/loki/image_name_l.png)
- `container_name`: Querying based on the running container name

    **Query:**
      ![container_name_query](images/loki/container_name_q.png)
    **Logs:**
      ![container_name_logs](images/loki/container_name_l.png)
- `time`: Querying based on a specific time

    **Query:**
      ![time_query](images/loki/time_q.png)
    **Logs:**
      ![time_logs](images/loki/time_l.png)
- `stream`: Querying based type of log output (normal/error)

    **Query:**
      ![stream_query](images/loki/stream_q.png)
    **Logs:**
      ![stream_logs](images/loki/stream_l.png)
