1. Created an account on Yandex Cloud.
2. Install Cloud CLI
3. Create and setup service account
4. Setup IDs

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

│ Warning: Incomplete lock file information for providers
│ 
│ Due to your customized provider installation methods, Terraform was forced to calculate lock file checksums locally for the following providers:

│ The current .terraform.lock.hcl file only includes checksums for darwin_arm64, so Terraform running on another platform will fail to install these providers.
