## Terraform with yandex cloud
1) First of all I need to create to install yc cli tool. After instalation and providing an oauth token go futher
3) According to the guide create a service account and grand the account with editor role for resource-manager in my default folder
4) Fetching the authorized key and configure yc profile to run commands from the service that will allow to skip providing token in my main.tf
5) Configure terraformrc to fetch from yandex registry.
6) Create main.tc with yandex provider as shown in the guide
7) After the guide completion I have 2 VM setup via terraform

## Best practices
- Keeping sensitive in sucure using tf variables
- Using gitignore for tf generated files
- Organizing terraform configs in separate files
- Use terraform plan before terraform apply
- Files are formated using terraform fmt command
