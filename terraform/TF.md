## Yandex Cloud Infrastructure

### Setup Steps
1. Created an account on Yandex Cloud.
2. Followed the Yandex Quickstart Guide to set up Terraform.
3. Configured the necessary resources.


### Challenges
- Encountered issues with authentication, resolved by following the documentation.



## GitHub Infrastructure

### Best Practices
