# Terraform

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### Code organization

Terraform code is separated into `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, and `outputs.tf` files to ensure modularity.

### Version Constraints

Specifying Terraform and provider versions to avoid unexpected updates.

### Secrets

Secrets are stored in a `terraform.tfvars` file, which is added to the `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental pushes to VCS.

### Validating and Formating

Using `terraform validate` and `terraform fmt` to ensure the code is correct.

### Checking Changes

Using `terraform plan` to check the changes and review them.

### `terraform state list`

<details>
<summary>Open output</summary>

```cmd
terraform\docker> terraform state list
docker_container.go_webapp_container
docker_container.python_webapp_container
```

</details>

### `terraform state show`

<details>
<summary>Open output for <code>go_webapp_container</code></summary>

```cmd

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Yandex Cloud

I followed the tutorial: <https://yandex.cloud/en-ru/docs/tutorials/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart>.

There was a difficulty following it, in my opinion, the tutorial could be structured much better.

Terraform was already installed on my laptop, also I had already a Yandex Cloud account, but with not activated free trial.

I decided to follow the steps using the Yandex Cloud CLI, which I had to install. It was very easy.

I chose managing resources on behalf of my Yandex account, which looked simplier than using the service accounts. Using `yc init` I logged into my account and set the default cloud and folder. Also, using provided commands for PowerShell, I set the needed environmental variables and setup a `terraform.rc` file.

I created minimal `main.tf` file with `required_providers` section per tutorial and ran `terraform init`.

Then using their full template, I modified it to exclude second VM settings. Then I separated `main.tf` into `outputs.tf` and `variables.tf`.
