## **Yandex Cloud Infrastructure Using Terraform**

### **1. Install Yandex Cloud CLI**

To begin, I install the Yandex Cloud CLI by running:

```bash
curl -sSL https://storage.yandexcloud.net/yandexcloud-yc/install.sh | bash
```

### **2. Log in to Yandex Cloud**

I authenticate my Yandex Cloud account using:

```bash
yc init
```

### **3. Create a Service Account**

I create a service account to manage Terraform resources:

```bash
yc iam service-account create --name terraform-sa
```

### **4. Assign Required Roles**

I assign the necessary roles to my service account:

```bash
yc resource-manager folder add-access-binding <my-folder-id> \
  --role <role> --subject serviceAccount:<my-service-account-id>
```

### **5. Generate a Service Account Key**

I generate a service account key and save it to a file:

```bash
yc iam key create --service-account-id <my-service-account-id> --output sa-key.json
```

### **6. Create a Terraform Project**

I create a new Terraform project and define the infrastructure inside `main.tf`.  

```bash
mkdir yacloud && cd yacloud
touch main.tf
```

## **7. Initialize Terraform**

Before applying my configuration, I initialize and validate Terraform:

```bash
terraform init
terraform validate
```

### **8. Apply the Terraform Configuration**

Finally, I apply my Terraform configuration to create resources:

```bash
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

## Challenges Encountered & Solutions

### **Determining Which Roles to Assign**

- Initially, I was unsure which roles were required for Terraform to work correctly with Yandex Cloud.
- **Solution:** I researched Yandex Cloud IAM roles and assigned the following:
  - `editor` for general management
  - `vpc.privateAdmin` for network operations
  - `compute.admin` for managing VM instances

### **Incorrect Image ID for VM**

- **Problem:** My VM creation failed because the image ID was incorrect.
- **Solution:** I ran the following command to get the correct **image ID** for Ubuntu:

  ```bash
  yc compute image list --folder-id standard-images
  ```

### **Finding the Correct Subnet ID**

- **Problem:** The Terraform configuration required a subnet ID, which I didnâ€™t have.
- **Solution:** I listed available subnets using:

  ```bash
  yc vpc subnet list
  ```
  
## Best Practices for Terraform in GitHub Infrastructure

### Use Environment Variables for Secrets

- Store sensitive tokens like `GITHUB_TOKEN` as environment variables, **not** in `.tf` files.
- Example: `export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token_here"`

### Use the `terraform import` Command for Existing Repositories

- Avoid creating a duplicate repository if one already exists.
- Use `terraform import github_repository.<resource_name> <repo_name>`.

### Keep Terraform Code in a Separate Repository or Directory

- Use a dedicated **Terraform repository** or a `github-terraform/` directory to **separate code infrastructure from project code**.

### Use `.gitignore` to Exclude Sensitive Files

- Add `.terraform/` and `.terraform.tfstate` to `.gitignore` to avoid committing Terraform state files.

### **Always Run `terraform plan` Before `apply`**

- Helps preview infrastructure changes before execution.
- Example:

  ```bash
  terraform plan
  terraform apply -auto-approve
  ```
