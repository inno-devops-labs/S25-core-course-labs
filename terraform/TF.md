# Yandex Cloud Infrastracture Using Terraform

## Steps of setup process I conducted for this task while following the tutorial:

1. Created the authorization key

```bash
yc iam key create --service-account-id ajega92b8k6n34ld8frk --folder-name default --output key.json
```

2. Created CLI profile and set a key, cloud id and folder id:

```bash
yc config profile create mangocandle
yc config set service-account-key key.json
yc config set cloud-id b1giddn06kdaavqqc3q4
yc config set folder-id  b1gp1q09cfrjs3apn9si
```

3. Added authentication data to the environment variables:
   export YC_TOKEN=$(yc iam create-token)
export YC_CLOUD_ID=$(yc config get cloud-id)
   export YC_FOLDER_ID=$(yc config get folder-id)

4. Changed configuration file - added info about yandex cloud provider (./yandex/main.tf).

5. Created VM:

```bash
yc compute instance create --name first-instance --zone ru-central1-a --network-interface subnet-name=default-ru-central1-a,nat-ip-version=ipv4 --create-boot-disk image-folder-id=standard-images,image-family=centos-7 --ssh-key ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

After that, created the disk image:

```bash
yc compute image create --name my-centos7-image --source-disk-id <fhmbelfi38i338acstd6> --family my-centos7
```

Checked that the image was created:

```bash
yc compute image list --folder-id b1gp1q09cfrjs3apn9si
```

And got the approval output:
|ID|NAME|FAMILY|PRODUCT IDS|STATUS|
|fd8ajmlu71ueu1ithstd|my-centos7-image|my-centos7|f2ef8jjf5v2g9h88kapc|READY|

5. Run the command to apply changes:

```bash

6. Checked the results: after all the previous steps in my online Yandex Cloud profile I checked that VM was there - and it was there and running.

## Challenges I faced during following YC tutorial:

First of all, the tutorial has a lot of nested links and steps, it was not convenient and clear what and how to do step by step, as I had to go to one link from the initial tutorial, then from it (to configure something else that turned out to be crucial) I had to follow another sub-tutorial and complete it and so on.

Also, the problem was with creating the Virtual Machine, image and understanding all the related things. There was no clear enough instruction, so I had to google and explore YC documentation for hours to do it all right and finally see a Cloud Compute section in my YC account.
