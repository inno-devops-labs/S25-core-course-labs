Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform: Best Practices

Sensitive information is securely managed using environment variables.

The Terraform directory is well-structured, with dedicated folders for Docker, Yandex, and GitHub configurations.

Terraform files are consistently named: main.tf for core configurations, variables.tf for variable definitions, and outputs.tf for output specifications.

As a best practice, always run terraform fmt and terraform validate before executing terraform apply to ensure the configuration is properly formatted and valid.

Docker Configuration

Use terraform show to view detailed information about the Terraform-managed Docker resources.
