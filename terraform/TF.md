## Yandex Journey

1. Installed yc thing, completed authentification.
2. `terraform init`
3. Configurating using the guide:
    - add a payment method
    - ssh keys
    - main.tf
    - .terraformrc
    - fixed configuration
    - run `terraform plan`, got auth error, fixed by changing token parameter

```bash
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  [32m+[0m create[0m

Terraform will perform the following actions:

Now I run `terraform apply` to execute the plan.
