# CI Workflow Best Practices

## CI Workflow Overview

The CI workflow automates the process of testing, building, and deploying the JavaScript application using GitHub Actions.

## Key Practices Applied

### 1. **Cache Dependencies**
   - **Why**: Caching the `node_modules` directory reduces the time spent on reinstalling dependencies in every build.
   - **How**: GitHub Actions `actions/cache` is used to store the dependencies cache based on the `package-lock.json` file.

### 2. **Linting**
   - **Why**: Linting helps maintain code consistency and catch syntax issues early in the development process.
   - **How**: The `eslint` tool is used to analyze the JavaScript code.

### 3. **Docker Support**
   - **Why**: Docker allows us to package the application in a consistent environment that can be deployed anywhere.
   - **How**: Docker Hub integration is used to build and push Docker images during the CI pipeline.

### 4. **Snyk Vulnerability Scanning**
   - **Why**: Security is a priority, and Snyk helps identify known vulnerabilities in the dependencies.
   - **How**: Snyk is integrated into the CI workflow to perform security scans on the dependencies after each build.

### 5. **CI Badge**
   - **Why**: The CI badge provides visibility into the current state of the workflow, making it easier to track build and test status.
   - **How**: A GitHub Actions status badge is added to the README file.
