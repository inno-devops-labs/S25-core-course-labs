- Separate workflow for this project, aside from the `app_python`
- Caching implemented in steps where it's possible
- Using actions whenever possible (as they are more reliable)
- Secrets properly used (no cridentials in public)
- Properly named steps
- Proper, specific version for software
- Security scan is included
