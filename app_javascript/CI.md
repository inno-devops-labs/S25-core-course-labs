# CI Workflow Best Practices Implemented

1. **Caching Dependencies**: We use GitHub Actions' caching mechanism to speed up npm dependency installation.
2. **Linting**: The workflow includes an ESLint step to enforce code quality standards before deployment.
3. **Automated Testing**: Jest tests run in every push and pull request to ensure stability.
4. **Security Scanning**: Integrated Snyk to detect vulnerabilities in `package.json`.
5. **Docker Optimization**:
   - Uses a distroless image for security and efficiency.
   - Implements multi-stage builds to reduce image size.
6. **Workflow Status Badge**: Provides visibility on the CI pipeline status.
7. **Secrets Management**: Uses GitHub Secrets to securely store credentials for Docker and Snyk.

Every commit and pull request that affects the relevant parts of the repository(app_javascript folder) triggers this workflow, ensuring continuous integration and delivery best practices are maintained.
