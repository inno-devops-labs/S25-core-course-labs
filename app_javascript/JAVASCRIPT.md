# Project reasoning

## Why Bare Node + Express?

It's a small project that aims to create a snake game from as little as possible, there is no need in bloat
that is webframeworks for this purpose. Though some more libraries might be used later in development.

# Coding standards

1. Clear project structure
2. following naming and formatting standards
3. Simple, self-explanatory code

# Testing

Is not yet implemented. The game logic is currently too simple for that, however as the game evolves some testing on complex
game/UI logic will be implemented.
