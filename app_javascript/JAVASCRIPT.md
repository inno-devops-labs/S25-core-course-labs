# JavaScript Web Application

## Framework Choice: Express.js
Express.js was chosen for its minimalistic approach and efficiency in handling HTTP requests.

## Best Practices
- Used `moment-timezone` for timezone management.
- Kept code modular and simple.
- Used `npm` for dependency management.

## Testing
- Tested locally by accessing the app in a browser and confirming the displayed time updates.
