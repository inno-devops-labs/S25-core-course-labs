# Flutter Yekaterinburg Time Web App

## Framework Choice

I chose **Flutter** as a UI framework for its ease
of use in creating scalable, production-ready, cross-platform applications.

## Best Practices

- **Modular Code**: The application follows the principle
  of [Clean Architecture](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/complete-guide-to-clean-architecture/)
  and provides strict way to separate business logic (domain layer) from the presentation layer.

- **Dart analysis Compliance**: The code conforms to standard Dart analysis
  to avoid potential warnings and errors and ensure consistent formatting.

- **Naming Conventions**: camelCase is used for variables and functions
  to enhance code readability and maintainability.

- **Integration testing**: Widget testing is implemented with
  Flutter widget testing to ensure that functionality is valid
