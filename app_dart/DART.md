## 1. **Best Practices Applied**

### **Separation of Concerns**
- The code is structured with a clear separation of concerns:
  - `server.dart` handles the HTTP server logic and requests.
  - `app_dart.dart` contains the logic for fetching the current time from the API, ensuring that each file serves a specific purpose.
  
### **Asynchronous Programming**
- Dartâ€™s `async` and `await` keywords are used effectively to handle asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from an API (`getMoscowTime()`), ensuring that the server remains responsive without blocking execution.
  
### **Error Handling**
- The `getMoscowTime()` function has appropriate error handling using a `try-catch` block to handle network issues and timeouts when requesting data from the API. If an error occurs, it returns a meaningful message to the user.

### **Formatting Output**
- The time data fetched from the API is formatted correctly to be human-readable. This is done by replacing the `T` character in the ISO8601 time format with a space (`' '`), which improves readability for users.

## 2. **Coding Standards**

### **Code Readability**
- Consistent indentation (2 spaces) is used throughout the code, improving its readability.
- Function and variable names are descriptive (`getMoscowTime()`, `handleRequest()`), making the code easier to understand for both the author and other developers.
  
### **Comments and Documentation**
- Clear comments are used to explain non-obvious logic, such as the reason for formatting the time string or handling exceptions.
- HTML embedded in Dart is kept simple and readable, with inline styles and structure clearly laid out.

### **Use of Libraries and Packages**
- The project uses standard Dart libraries like `http` for network requests and `shelf` for creating the web server. This is a best practice because it allows for modular and extensible code while leveraging widely-used and well-maintained libraries.

## 3. **Testing Implementation**

### **Manual Testing**
- The application was test manually (under different constraints) to check its functionality.

## 4. **Ensuring Code Quality**

### **Linting**
- The Dart project follows proper linting rules, ensuring that the code adheres to consistent coding conventions. Linting tools like `dart analyze` can be used to identify issues such as unused imports, style violations, or possible errors.

### **Error Handling and Logging**
- Proper error handling is implemented with `try-catch` blocks to manage potential exceptions during network requests.
- A middleware (e.g., `logRequests()`) is used to log requests for debugging and performance monitoring.
