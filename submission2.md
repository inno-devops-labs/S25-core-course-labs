# Lab 16 Submission: IPFS and Fleek

## Task 1: Set Up an IPFS Gateway Using Docker

### Docker Container Setup
- IPFS container successfully set up with Docker
- Container ID: 7f3a623b1fda
- Exposed ports: 4001, 5001, 8080

### IPFS File Upload
- File uploaded: test.txt
- File hash: QmUVY5EySnk5CaNskgXgCe7GnDyuo25S6oHd2QRZse5EYk
- Gateway URLs used:
  - https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUVY5EySnk5CaNskgXgCe7GnDyuo25S6oHd2QRZse5EYk
  - https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmUVY5EySnk5CaNskgXgCe7GnDyuo25S6oHd2QRZse5EYk
  - https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmUVY5EySnk5CaNskgXgCe7GnDyuo25S6oHd2QRZse5EYk

### Connected Peers and Bandwidth
- Connected peers: 165+ peers (extensive list of IP addresses and peer IDs)
- Bandwidth stats:
  - TotalIn: 5,182,089 bytes
  - TotalOut: 934,388 bytes
  - RateIn: 14,069.87 bytes/sec
  - RateOut: 3,385.04 bytes/sec

## Task 2: Set Up Project on Fleek.xyz

### Research
- IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a distributed system for storing and accessing files, websites, applications, and data. It aims to replace HTTP with a more distributed and efficient protocol.
- Fleek is a platform that simplifies deploying and hosting websites/apps on IPFS, providing features like CI/CD, custom domains, and more.

### Project Setup
- Fleek account: [Will be added]
- Project source: S25-core-course-labs repository
- IPFS link: [Will be added after deployment]
- Domain: [Will be added after deployment]
