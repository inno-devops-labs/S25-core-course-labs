## Task 2: Project on Fleek.xyz

### Research Notes

- IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a distributed system for storing and accessing files, websites, applications, and data. It aims to make the web more resilient by addressing content by what it is, not where it's located.
- Fleek is a platform that simplifies the deployment of websites and applications to IPFS, providing a seamless way to host content on the decentralized web.

### Project Deployment
