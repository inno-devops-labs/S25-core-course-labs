# This is the default AWS EC2 inventory file for Ansible
# It defines the basic inventory structure for local development and testing

all:                              # The 'all' group contains all hosts
 hosts:                          # Define the hosts in this group
   localhost:                    # Configure localhost as a target
     ansible_connection: local   # Use local connection type instead of SSH
                                # This allows Ansible to run commands directly
                                # on the control node without SSH
