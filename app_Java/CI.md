# Continuous Integration (CI) Best Practices for Java Application

## Workflow Optimization
### Configured CI to Run Only on Relevant Changes  
- The workflow triggers **only when changes occur in the `app_Java/` directory**, reducing unnecessary builds.

### Dependency Caching for Faster Builds  
- Used **GitHub Actions cache** to store Maven dependencies, reducing redundant installations.
- This significantly improves CI performance.

### Automated Testing and Code Validation  
- Ensures that every **pull request and push** runs **JUnit tests** before merging.
- **Maven build validation** ensures that the code compiles correctly.

### Security Scanning with Snyk  
- Integrated **Snyk vulnerability scans** to detect and report security issues in dependencies.
- The workflow allows CI to **pass unless the vulnerabilities are upgradable**.

### Docker Integration for Deployment  
- The pipeline **builds a Docker image** for the application after passing all tests.
- If tests pass, the image is **automatically pushed to Docker Hub**.
