# ASP.NET Web Application (Web Forms) Nothern Lights

## Why ASP.NET Web Forms?
- ASP.NET Web Forms follows the **Master-Page and Code-Behind** architecture.
- **Master Pages** provide a consistent layout, while individual **content pages** handle specific functionality.
- **Event-driven programming** simplifies UI interaction.
- Built-in **state management**, security features, and easy database integration.

## Best Practices:
- Used **Master Pages (`.master`)** for a consistent UI layout.
- Followed **separation of concerns** by keeping business logic in **code-behind files (`.aspx.cs`)**.
- Used `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files (e.g., `bin/`, `obj/`).
- Implemented **CSS animations** and JavaScript for a smooth visual experience.

## How to Test the Application?
- Run the server and ensure the **Northern Lights animation** appears full-screen.
- Verify that the **displayed text is visible and responsive**.
- Refresh the page and check that the animation resets properly.
