# CI Best Practices

## Optimizing CI Workflow
1. **Parallel Jobs**: Splitted jobs into independent stages (e.g., testing, security scans, and Docker builds) allows faster execution.
2. **Dependency Caching**:
   - Utilized `cache: true` in `setup-go` for caching Go modules and dependencies.
   - Used `--cache-from` for Docker builds to avoid unnecessary rebuilds.
3. **Security Checks**:
   - Integrated Snyk to scan for vulnerabilities before deployment.
4. **Error Handling**:
   - Used `continue-on-error: true` in security checks to allow CI/CD to continue despite warnings.
5. **Version Pinning**:
   - Specified explicit versions for dependencies and actions to ensure consistent behavior.
6. **Automated Linting & Testing**:
   - Ensured code quality with `golangci-lint`.
   - Run unit tests automatically on each commit.

## Security Enhancements
### Snyk Integration
Snyk is used to scan the project for vulnerabilities before deployment.
