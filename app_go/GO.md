# Moscow Date Web-Application

## Technological Stack

For this application I have used [Go](https://go.dev/) with the standard library [net/http](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http).
Go is a statically typed, compiled language that is fast and easy to use.
It is appropriate for this application because it is easy and fast to develop with it.

## Best Practices

- Models for response validation and serialization.
- Code documentation and comments.
- Proper code naming.
- Clean code structure.
- Clean code formatting.

## Coding Standards and Code Quality

- I used [gofmt](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/gofmt) to format the code and check the code style.

## Testing

- I tested the application by running it and checking the displayed date in Moscow using the browser.
- Then I tested the application next day by refreshing the page and checking if the displayed date updates.
