# Random Daily Predictions

## Task 1

### Choose a suitable framework for your web application and justify your choice

I chose Go's built-in net/http package because:

1) It is lightweight, performant, and suitable for simple web applications
2) It is easy to use, test and debug

## Task 2

### Describe best practices applied in the web application

1) Using camelCase for variable names
2) Keeping the code clean and readable

### Explain how you followed coding standards, implemented testing, and ensured code quality

I followed the following coding standards:

1) Organized the code for clarity and ensured logical separation of concerns.
2) Descriptive naming like randomPrediction to enhance code readability

**Testing:**

Obviously, I checked that the web application generates and displays a random prediction upon each request.

**Code quality:**

The code runs without errors, the code is light and scalable.
