## Spring Boot Framework
For this exercise, I chose Spring Boot because of its ability to simplify application development with Java. The task doesnâ€™t require overly complex infrastructure, so Spring Boot's modularity and simplicity make it an ideal choice for a small-to-medium-sized project like this one.

## Best Practices
- Use Maven for dependency management
- Follow Java coding standards and conventions

---
## Testing
I tested manually

### Unit Tests

#### âœ… Test Cases Implemented

- **test_get_random_quote_html**: Verifies that the `/quotes/random` endpoint returns a successful response with the expected HTML format.
- **test_random_quote_content**: Validates that the response HTML contains a valid quote and author, checking for non-empty values in the `<p><strong>Quote:</strong>` and `<p><strong>Author:</strong>` tags.

#### ðŸ§ª Testing Approach

- Used **JUnit 5** for writing and executing tests in the Spring Boot project.
- Utilized **MockMvc** to simulate HTTP requests and assert responses in the controller.
- Ensured that responses have the correct status code (`200 OK`) and match the expected HTML content.
- Included assertions to verify the structure and content of the returned HTML.
