# Justification for Framework Choice

I selected **SpringBoot** as the framework for this web application because it is popular in Java backend.
And simple **Maven** as a build system because it is more fitting for my small web application.

## Best Practices Applied

- **Dependency Management**: Utilized Maven for managing project dependencies, ensuring consistent and reproducible builds.
- **Project Structure**: Followed the standard Maven layout to organize code effectively.
- **Coding Standards**: Adhered to Oracle's Java coding conventions to maintain code readability and consistency across the project.

## Testing and Code Quality

- **Manual Testing:** Tested the application by running it locally and checking that the gif is displayed correctly.
