# ArgoCD

## Deploy and Configure

### Add to Helm repository

```shell
helm repo add argo https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm
```

```text
"argo" has been added to your repositories
```

### Install ArgoCD

```shell
helm install argo argo/argo-cd --namespace argocd --create-namespace
```

```text
NAME: argo
LAST DEPLOYED: Sun Mar 16 15:05:10 2025
NAMESPACE: argocd
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
In order to access the server UI you have the following options:

1. kubectl port-forward service/argo-argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443

    and then open the browser on http://localhost:8080 and accept the certificate

2. enable ingress in the values file `server.ingress.enabled` and either
      - Add the annotation for ssl passthrough: https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/ingress/#option-1-ssl-passthrough
      - Set the `configs.params."server.insecure"` in the values file and terminate SSL at your ingress: https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/ingress/#option-2-multiple-ingress-objects-and-hosts


After reaching the UI the first time you can login with username: admin and the random password generated during the installation. You can find the password by running:

kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d

(You should delete the initial secret afterwards as suggested by the Getting Started Guide: https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/#4-login-using-the-cli)
```

### Verify installation

```shell
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app.kubernetes.io/name=argocd-server -n argocd --timeout=90s
```

```text
pod/argo-argocd-server-7b688c6d85-lm76d condition met
```

### Install ArgoCD CLI

```shell
brew install argocd
```

```shell
argocd version
```

```text
argocd: v2.14.5+f463a94
  BuildDate: 2025-03-11T04:57:25Z
  GitCommit: f463a945d57267e9691cede37021d9ddc5994f36

```

### Access the ArgoCD UI

#### Forward server port

```shell
kubectl port-forward svc/argo-argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443 &
```

```text
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8080 -> 8080
Forwarding from [::1]:8080 -> 8080
```

Now UI is available on http://localhost:8080:
