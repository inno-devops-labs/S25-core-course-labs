#### Argo panel

#### Explanation

ArgoCD continuously monitors the desired state (as defined in Git) and the live state. Manual changes to deployments,
such as changing the replica count, are automatically reverted to match the Git state. Similarly, if a pod is deleted,
Kubernetes recreates it to meet the desired replica count without showing configuration drift.
