# Introduction to Helm

## Task 1: Helm Setup and Chart Creation

During the Helm setup, I have done the following things:

- generated a Helm chart for my application
- replaced default repository and tag inside `values.yaml`

I did not encounter any issues, so I did not comment out `livenessProbe` and `readinessProbe`.

Here are the screenshots that confirm the healthiness of Helm:

Output of `kubectl get pods,svc`:

## Task 2: Helm Chart Hooks

I have implemented Helm Chart Hooks (pre-install and post-install).

The output of `kubectl get po`:

```bash
> kubectl get po

Also, I implemented the Hook Delete Policy, such that it will remove the hook once it has executed successfully (`"helm.sh/hook-delete-policy": "hook-succeeded"`).

Here are the screenshots confirming the correctness of Hook Delete Policy:

![Confirmation of Hook Delete Policy work](./img/helm_delete_policy.png)

### List of requirements

- [x] Helm Chart with Hooks implemented, including the hook delete policy.
- [x] Output of the `kubectl get pods,svc` command in `HELM.md`.
- [x] Output of all commands from the step 4 of Task 2 in `HELM.md`.

## Bonus Task: Helm Library Chart

### Helm Chart for Extra App

I have added Helm Chart for my additional Golang application. I have decided to keep the same functionality, as for Python application Helm chart.

### Create a Library Chart

I have developed a simple library chart that includes `labels` template.

The dependency was specified in the following way:

![The way how dependency was specified](./img/helm_bonus_2.png)

So, then I have successfully updated the dependencies of both charts and used my library in both applications:
