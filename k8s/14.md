# Lab 14: Kubernetes StatefulSet Report

## Task 1: StatefulSet Implementation and Exploration

### 1. StatefulSet and Pod Status

The following command was used to check the status of Pods, StatefulSets, Services, and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs):

```bash
kubectl get po,sts,svc,pvc
```

**Output:**

```log
NAME               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/app-python-0   1/1     Running   0          14m
pod/app-python-1   1/1     Running   0          13m
pod/app-python-2   1/1     Running   0          13m

```

### 2. Accessing the Application

The application was accessed from:

- The primary browser window
- The guest browser window
- Incognito browser mode

**Output**

```log
ali@alivm:~/Desktop/VS_stuff/DevOps/LAB14/S25-core-course-Labs$ kubectl exec app-python-0 -- cat visits
• 108ali@alivm:~/Desktop/VS_stuff/DevOps/LAB14/S25-core-course-labs$ kubectl exec app-python-1 -- cat visits
• 103ali@alivm:~/Desktop/VS_stuff/DevOps/LAB14/S25-core-course-labs$ kubectl exec app-python-2 -- cat visits
100ali@alivm:~/Desktop/VS_stuff/DevOps/LAB14/S25-core-course-labs$
```

### 3. Visit Count Across Pods

The number of visits was checked for each pod using the following command:

```bash
kubectl exec pod/app-python-0 -- cat visits
kubectl exec pod/app-python-1 -- cat visits
kubectl exec pod/app-python-2 -- cat visits
```

**Observation:**
The number of visits is different for each pod. This occurs because incoming requests are distributed across multiple pods, and each pod writes to its own `visits` file stored in its persistent volume. Since each replica maintains a separate counter, the visit counts vary across the pods.

---

## Task 2: Persistent Storage Validation

### 1. Deleting and Recreating a Pod

The following command was used to delete a pod:

```bash
kubectl delete pod app-python-0
```

**Output:**

```log
pod "app-python-0" deleted
```

After deletion, Kubernetes automatically recreated the pod as part of the StatefulSet. The Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) remained bound, ensuring data persistence.

### 2. Verifying Data Persistence

The following commands were used to verify the PVC and data:

```bash
kubectl get pvc
kubectl exec app-python-0 -- cat visits
```


**Observation:**
After the pod was recreated, the visit count was initially unavailable (`No such file or directory`). This suggests that the application either failed to restore the previous state or reinitialized the file upon pod restart. After a few requests, the counter started from a low value (e.g., 8, then 1), indicating potential data loss or reinitialization logic in the application.

**Output:**

```log

## Task 3: Headless Service Access

### 1. Accessing Pods via DNS

The following command was used to resolve the DNS for a pod:

```bash
kubectl exec app-python-0 -- nslookup app-python-1.app-python
```

**Output:**

```log
Server:    10.96.0.10
Address 1: 10.96.0.10 kube-dns.kube-system.svc.cluster.local

Name:      app-python-1.app-python
Address 1: 10.244.0.10 app-python-1.app-python.default.svc.cluster.local
```

**Output:**

```log
• ali@alivm:~/Desktop/VS_stuff/DevOps/LAB14/S25-core-course-Labs$ kubectl exec app-python-0 -- nslookup app-python-1.app-python
Server:         10.96.0.10

## Task 4: Monitoring & Alerts

### 1. Liveness and Readiness Probes

Liveness and readiness probes were added to the StatefulSet to ensure pod health. These probes:

- **Liveness Probe:** Restarts the pod if the application becomes unresponsive.
- **Readiness Probe:** Ensures the pod is ready to receive traffic.

**Why Probes Are Critical for Stateful Applications:**
Stateful applications rely on consistent state and persistent storage. Probes ensure that only fully initialized and operational pods handle traffic, preventing issues like data corruption or partial writes. They also help maintain system stability by automatically recovering unhealthy pods.

---

## Task 5: Ordering Guarantee and Parallel Operations

### 1. Why Ordering Guarantees Are Unnecessary

Ordering guarantees ensure that pods are created or terminated in a specific sequence. For this application, ordering is unnecessary because:

- Each pod operates independently.
- There are no strict dependencies between pods.
- The application can tolerate simultaneous creation or termination of pods.

### 2. Implementing Parallel Pod Launch or Termination

To allow parallel pod creation or termination, the `podManagementPolicy` in the StatefulSet was set to `Parallel`. Here’s the updated YAML snippet:

## Bonus Task: Update Strategies

### 1. Applying StatefulSet to Bonus Application

The bonus application was converted to use a StatefulSet. The following command was used to check the status:

```bash
kubectl get po,sts,svc,pvc
```

**Output:**

### 2. Exploring Update Strategies

#### OnDelete vs. RollingUpdate

- **OnDelete:** Updates are applied only when pods are manually deleted. This provides full control but requires manual intervention.
- **RollingUpdate:** Pods are updated gradually, minimizing downtime. The `partition` field can be used to control which pods are updated first.

#### Comparison with Deployment Strategies

- **Recreate (Deployments):** All pods are stopped before new ones are created, causing downtime.
- **RollingUpdate (Deployments):** Pods are replaced gradually, ensuring continuous service.
- **StatefulSets:** Require `RollingUpdate` to maintain ordered updates and data consistency.
