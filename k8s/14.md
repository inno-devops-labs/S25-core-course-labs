After deploying
```bash
  kubectl get pods
```
output
```bash

This problems with app, not with statefulset:

```bash
  kubectl describe pod app-0

I actually got this errors in all my way with kubernetes and this is not helm config fault)

after deleting the pod

```bash
  kubectl get pvc
```
```bash

```
- PVCs remain bound after pod deletion.
- Pod `app-0` retained its visit count, confirming persistence.

since the image cannot start well, we cannot see the container (but minikube deploys it)
```bash
  kubectl exec app-0 -- nslookup app-stateful-1.app-stateful
```

```bash
error: Internal error occurred: unable to upgrade connection: container not found ("my-app")
```


**Probe health**

How probes ensure pod health
- Liveness Probe checks if the app inside a container is still running. If it fails, Kubernetes restarts the container automatically. 
- Headiness Probe checks whether the app is ready to serve traffic. If it fails, the pod is removed from the Service endpoints (no traffic is routed to it).

Why they’re critical for stateful apps
- Stateful apps manage persistent data, so blindly routing traffic to an initializing or broken pod can lead to data corruption or errors.
- A pod that takes longer to boot (e.g., database restore) won’t receive traffic until it’s ready.
- Faulty pods don’t go unnoticed—they’re restarted automatically by Kubernetes.

**Ordering guarantee and parallel pperations**

Why ordering guarantees Are Unnecessary for this app
- This application runs independent replicas that don’t rely on shared setup or inter-pod communication during boot.
- Each pod writes to its own PVC and handles its own state (like visit count).
- There's no need for app-0 to start before app-1


**Parallel StatefulSet**

In the StatefulSet manifest, we enabled parallel pod operations using:
```yaml
podManagementPolicy: Parallel
```

This tells the StatefulSet controller:
- Start or terminate pods concurrently
- Useful when ordering guarantees (the default OrderedReady) are irrelevant or a bottleneck
