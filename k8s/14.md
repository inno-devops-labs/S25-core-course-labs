## How Probes Ensure Pod Health
Liveness Probe: Ensures that the application is running and healthy. If the application crashes or becomes unresponsive, the liveness probe will fail, and Kubernetes will restart the container to recover the application.

Readiness Probe: Ensures that the application is ready to handle requests. If the application is still initializing or is temporarily unable to handle requests, the readiness probe will fail, and Kubernetes will stop sending traffic to the pod until it becomes ready again.

## Why Probes Are Critical for Stateful Apps
Stateful Applications: Stateful applications often manage critical data and require careful handling of startup, shutdown, and recovery processes. Probes help ensure that these applications are only marked as ready when they are truly capable of handling requests, preventing data corruption or loss.

High Availability: Probes help maintain high availability by ensuring that only healthy and ready pods receive traffic. This is especially important for stateful applications where data consistency and integrity are paramount.

Self-Healing: Probes enable Kubernetes to automatically detect and recover from failures, reducing the need for manual intervention and ensuring that the application remains available and responsive.
