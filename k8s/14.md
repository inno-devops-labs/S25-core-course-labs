# Stateful Sets

After StatefulSet setup we can see the following picture.
I've also disabled liveness and readiness probes because they were pointing to the
root page :)

## Data synchronization issues

```bash
➜  k8s git:(lab-14) ✗ kubectl get po,sts,svc,pvc
NAME                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/moscow-time-0   1/1     Running   0          30s
pod/moscow-time-1   1/1     Running   0          23s
pod/moscow-time-2   1/1     Running   0          15s

NAME                           READY   AGE
statefulset.apps/moscow-time   3/3     30s

NAME                  TYPE        CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
service/kubernetes    ClusterIP   10.96.0.1     <none>        443/TCP    11d
service/moscow-time   ClusterIP   10.109.83.2   <none>        8000/TCP   30s

NAME                                                  STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   VOLUMEATTRIBUTESCLASS   AGE
persistentvolumeclaim/moscow-time-pvc-moscow-time-0   Bound    pvc-e5f8941c-99f1-4f47-8dcc-8da232a1ffb1   100Mi      RWO            local-path     <unset>                 30s
persistentvolumeclaim/moscow-time-pvc-moscow-time-1   Bound    pvc-39baa617-4147-4571-b34c-938a9f685102   100Mi      RWO            local-path     <unset>                 23s
persistentvolumeclaim/moscow-time-pvc-moscow-time-2   Bound    pvc-50be5814-1144-4978-89de-68058085bba5   100Mi      RWO            local-path     <unset>                 15s
```

After multiple attempts to reach service, one can see following data in the `visits.txt` in pods.

```bash
➜  k8s git:(lab-14) ✗ kubectl exec moscow-time-0 -- cat /data/visits.txt
13
➜  k8s git:(lab-14) ✗ kubectl exec moscow-time-1 -- cat /data/visits.txt
1
➜  k8s git:(lab-14) ✗ kubectl exec moscow-time-2 -- cat /data/visits.txt
5
```

This occurs because each of the pods has its own volume where it stores its own `visits.txt` file.
And the service load balancer routes requests to different pods at different requests. So, reading
from these files gives us different unsychronized results.

## Pod deletion

As one can see from the experiment below, after pod deletion, the PVC still remains alive.
An the data retreived from the pod will be equal data before the deletion.

```bash
➜  k8s git:(lab-14) ✗ kubectl exec moscow-time-0 -- cat /data/visits.txt
13
➜  k8s git:(lab-14) ✗ kubectl delete pod moscow-time-0
pod "moscow-time-0" deleted
➜  k8s git:(lab-14) ✗ kubectl get po,sts,svc,pvc

➜  k8s git:(lab-14) ✗ kubectl exec moscow-time-0 -- cat /data/visits.txt
13%
```

## DNS resolution

For some reason that I did not troubleshoot yet, I am unable to use StatefulSet DNS
to ping pods :( Only cluster wide FQDN.

```bash
➜  k8s git:(lab-14) ✗ kubectl exec moscow-time-0 -- nslookup moscow-time-1.moscow-time.default.svc.cluster.local
Server:		10.96.0.10
Address:	10.96.0.10:53


Name:	moscow-time-1.moscow-time.default.svc.cluster.local
Address: 10.244.1.185
➜  k8s git:(lab-14) ✗ kubectl exec moscow-time-0 -- nslookup moscow-time-1.moscow-time
Server:		10.96.0.10
Address:	10.96.0.10:53

** server can't find moscow-time-1.moscow-time: NXDOMAIN

```
