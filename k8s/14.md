Both pods report a visits counter value of "3". This consistency indicates that the persistent storage is functioning correctly.

##### Answers: 

1) Liveness probe restarts the container if it hangs, and readiness probe tells you when the container is ready to receive traffic.
2) It is especially important for stateful applications to know that each Pod is working correctly and data is not lost when failures occur.
