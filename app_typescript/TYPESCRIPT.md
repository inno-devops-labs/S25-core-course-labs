# Typescript Web Application

## Tech Stack

* Typescript
* Vite, as it is "blazing fast frontend build tool powering the next generation of web applications.". 
  Currently, it's the best way to create frontend projects.
* React, for its simplicity. React lets you build user interfaces out of individual pieces called components.

## Best practises

* I have followed KISS principle which is the most suitable for such simple apps.
* I have configured project using [vite](https://vite.dev/).
* I have configured `pre-commit` hooks using [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/)
  (see [pre-commit](.husky/pre-commit))
* I have configured static type checking using [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* I have configured code formatting
  with [eslint](https://eslint.org/) and [prettier](https://prettier.io/)

## Testing

The application is tested manually by me by comparing output
