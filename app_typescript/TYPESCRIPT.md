# TypeScript Web Application

## Framework

I chose **Vite** with **React and TypeScript**. My experience with Vite played a big role in my choice. I like the quick setup, it works out of the box with TypeScript, reducing setup time.

Why TypeScript? There are also several reasons, the main ones are that TypeScript allows you to explicitly specify data types, which helps identify errors at the compilation stage; thanks to typing and additional features, the code in TypeScript is more structured and understandable. These are the reasons I like.

## Best Practices Applied

- **Type Safety**: Used TypeScript for strong type checking and maintainability.
- **Linting & Formatting**: Configured ESLint and Prettier for consistent code style.
