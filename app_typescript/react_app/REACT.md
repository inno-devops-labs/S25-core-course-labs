# Web application using React and Typescript

## Why Use React?

- **Component-Based Architecture**: React encourages building reusable UI components, which helps in managing complex UIs and making them maintainable over time.
- **Performance**: React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update only the parts of the UI that have changed, resulting in faster rendering and better performance.

## Why Use TypeScript?

- **Static Typing**: TypeScript's type system helps catch errors at compile time, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors and improving code quality.
- **Improved Developer Experience**: Features like autocompletion, refactoring tools, and error checking in IDEs enhance the development workflow, making it faster and more efficient.

## Good Practices

- **Good Documentation** I have tried to provide good documentation using the markdown files and comments.
