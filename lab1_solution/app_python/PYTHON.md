# Python application

## Framework:

For the current lab was chosen a Flask framework since it is a easy-to-understand framework that allows convenient debug mode for applications

## Best practices:

* Application was written according to the PEP8 standart.

* Testing was realised using a built-in Flask debugger. However, its functionality was tested by simply refreshing the page several times.

* Enabled SSL for security purposes using adhoc (that is the one of the simplest way to do it and for developement it is better to acquire a real sertificate rather than self-signed).
