# NODEJS.md

## Framework Choice

I chose Express for this web application because it is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

## Best Practices

- **Code Structure:** Organized the code into separate modules and directories for better maintainability.
- **Error Handling:** Implemented error handling for 404 pages.
- **Templates:** Used EJS templates for rendering HTML pages.

## Coding Standards

- Followed JavaScript coding standards.
- Used meaningful variable and function names.
- Added comments for functions.

## Testing

- Tested the application manually to ensure it displays the correct server time.
- Verified the error handling for 404 pages.
