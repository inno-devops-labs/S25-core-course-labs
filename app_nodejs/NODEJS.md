# Node.js Web Application

## Framework Choice
I chose **Express.js** because:
1. It is minimalistic and efficient for web applications.
2. Built-in routing support.

## Best Practices
1. Organized the app into modular components.
2. Used `moment` for timezone handling, which simplifies date and time management.

## Coding Standards
1. Code is written in a modular and readable way.
2. Variable names are descriptive and named in lowerCamelCase.

## Testing
1. Manualy verified that the app endpoint correctly displays Abu Dabi time.
2. Manualy tested app stability by loading the HTML page in the browser for multiple concurrent times.
