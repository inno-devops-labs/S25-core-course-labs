## Framework

I chose cpp-httplib framework because it is one of the easiest for understanding and writing small applications. I also better know C++ than other languages. These aspects were crucial this time for me.

## Best practices

The small size of the application does not allow for many practices. I have endeavored to keep the code readable and the comments comprehensive.


## Coding standards, testing, code quality

To check compliance with code writing standards and evaluate its quality, online code checking. tools were used. At this stage, no automation of thesiting was performed. Everything is checked manually by sending additional requests (page refresh) and comparing the results.
