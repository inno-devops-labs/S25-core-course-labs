# Rust Web Application

## Framework choice

I chose `Rocket` framework because I have a little experience with it, and this framework is one of the most common frameworks for `Rust`.
`Rocket` has all possible functionalities that can be used in web development.

## Best practices

- Code is well-commented and has documentation for further usage.
- Code passes `cargo check` and `cargo clippy`

## Testing

This application was tested manually by comparing the outputs with this [site](https://time.is/Moscow).
