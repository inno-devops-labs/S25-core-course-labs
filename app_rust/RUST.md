# app_rust

This web application generates a random unsigned 64-bit integer

## Framework Choice

For the implementation Actix was chosen as it was the most simple solution to the given task in my opinion.

## Best Practices

* Code is formatted using rustfmt
* Cargo is used for project and package managing
* Async architecture is used
* Logging is implemented using robust logging libraries (pretty_env_logger + log)
